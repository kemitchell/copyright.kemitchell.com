<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Original Works of Authorship.</strong> The t=
wo fundamental criteria of copyright protection=E2=80=94originality and fix=
ation in tangible form are restated in the first sentence of this cornersto=
ne provision. The phrase "original works or authorship," which is purposely=
 left undefined, is intended to incorporate without change the standard of =
originality established by the courts under the present copyright statute. =
This standard does not include requirements of novelty, ingenuity, or esthe=
tic merit, and there is no intention to enlarge the standard of copyright p=
rotection to require them.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In using the phrase "original works of authorship," =
rather than "all the writings of an author" now in section 4 of the statute=
 [section 4 of former title 17], the committee's purpose is to avoid exhaus=
ting the constitutional power of Congress to legislate in this field, and t=
o eliminate the uncertainties arising from the latter phrase. Since the pre=
sent statutory language is substantially the same as the empowering languag=
e of the Constitution [Const. Art. I, =C2=A78, cl. 8], a recurring question=
 has been whether the statutory and the constitutional provisions are coext=
ensive. If so, the courts would be faced with the alternative of holding co=
pyrightable something that Congress clearly did not intend to protect, or o=
f holding constitutionally incapable of copyright something that Congress m=
ight one day want to protect. To avoid these equally undesirable results, t=
he courts have indicated that "all the writings of an author" under the pre=
sent statute is narrower in scope than the "writings" of "authors" referred=
 to in the Constitution. The bill avoids this dilemma by using a different =
phrase=E2=80=94"original works of authorship"=E2=80=94in characterizing the=
 general subject matter of statutory copyright protection.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The history of copyright law has been one of gradual=
 expansion in the types of works accorded protection, and the subject matte=
r affected by this expansion has fallen into two general categories. In the=
 first, scientific discoveries and technological developments have made pos=
sible new forms of creative expression that never existed before. In some o=
f these cases the new expressive forms=E2=80=94electronic music, filmstrips=
, and computer programs, for example=E2=80=94could be regarded as an extens=
ion of copyrightable subject matter Congress had already intended to protec=
t, and were thus considered copyrightable from the outset without the need =
of new legislation. In other cases, such as photographs, sound recordings, =
and motion pictures, statutory enactment was deemed necessary to give them =
full recognition as copyrightable works.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Authors are continually finding new ways of expressi=
ng themselves, but it is impossible to foresee the <!-- PDFPage:12 -->forms=
 that these new expressive methods will take. The bill does not intend eith=
er to freeze the scope of copyrightable subject matter at the present stage=
 of communications technology or to allow unlimited expansion into areas co=
mpletely outside the present congressional intent. Section 102 implies neit=
her that that subject matter is unlimited nor that new forms of expression =
within that general area of subject matter would necessarily be unprotected=
.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The historic expansion of copyright has also applied=
 to forms of expression which, although in existence for generations or cen=
turies, have only gradually come to be recognized as creative and worthy of=
 protection. The first copyright statute in this country, enacted in 1790, =
designated only "maps, charts, and books"; major forms of expression such a=
s music, drama, and works of art achieved specific statutory recognition on=
ly in later enactments. Although the coverage of the present statute is ver=
y broad, and would be broadened further by the explicit recognition of all =
forms of choreography, there are unquestionably other areas of existing sub=
ject matter that this bill does not propose to protect but that future Cong=
resses may want to.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Fixation in Tangible Form.</strong> As a bas=
ic condition of copyright protection, the bill perpetuates the existing req=
uirement that a work be fixed in a "tangible medium of expression," and add=
s that this medium may be one "now known or later developed," and that the =
fixation is sufficient if the work "can be perceived, reproduced, or otherw=
ise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device." =
This broad language is intended to avoid the artificial and largely unjusti=
fiable distinctions, derived from cases such as <i>White-Smith Publishing C=
o. v. Apollo Co</i>., 209 U.S. 1 (1908) [28 S.Ct. 319, 52 L.Ed. 655], under=
 which statutory copyrightability in certain cases has been made to depend =
upon the form or medium in which the work is fixed. Under the bill it makes=
 no difference what the form, manner, or medium of fixation may be=E2=80=94=
whether it is in words, numbers, notes, sounds, pictures, or any other grap=
hic or symbolic indicia, whether embodied in a physical object in written, =
printed, photographic, sculptural, punched, magnetic, or any other stable f=
orm, and whether it is capable of perception directly or by means of any ma=
chine or device "now known or later developed."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the bill, the concept of fixation is important=
 since it not only determines whether the provisions of the statute apply t=
o a work, but it also represents the dividing line between common law and s=
tatutory protection. As will be noted in more detail in connection with sec=
tion 301, an unfixed work of authorship, such as an improvisation or an unr=
ecorded choreographic work, performance, or broadcast, would continue to be=
 subject to protection under State common law or statute, but would not be =
eligible for Federal statutory protection under section 102.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The bill seeks to resolve, through the definition of=
 "fixation" in section 101, the status of live broadcasts=E2=80=94sports, n=
ews coverage, live performances of music, etc.=E2=80=94that are reaching th=
e public in unfixed form but that are simultaneously being recorded. When a=
 football game is being covered by four television cameras, with a director=
 guiding the activities of the four cameramen and choosing which of their e=
lectronic images are sent out to the public and in what order, there is lit=
tle doubt that what the cameramen and the director are doing constitutes "a=
uthorship." The further question to be considered is whether there has been=
 a fixation. If the images and sounds to be broadcast are first recorded (o=
n a video tape, film, etc.) and then transmitted, the recorded work would b=
e considered a "motion picture" subject to statutory protection against una=
uthorized reproduction or retransmission of the broadcast. If the program c=
ontent is transmitted live to the public while being recorded at the same t=
ime, the case would be treated the same; the copyright owner would not be f=
orced to rely on common law rather than statutory rights in proceeding agai=
nst an infringing user of the live broadcast.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Thus, assuming it is copyrightable=E2=80=94as a "mot=
ion picture" or "sound recording," for example=E2=80=94the content of a liv=
e transmission should be regarded as fixed and should be accorded statutory=
 protection if it is being recorded simultaneously with its transmission. O=
n the other hand, the definition of "fixation" would exclude from the conce=
pt purely evanescent or transient reproductions such as those projected bri=
efly on a screen, shown electronically on a television or other cathode ray=
 tube, or captured momentarily in the "memory" of a computer.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the first sentence of the definition of "fixed=
" in section 101, a work would be considered "fixed in a tangible medium of=
 expression" if there has been an authorized embodiment in a copy or phonor=
ecord and if that embodiment "is sufficiently permanent or stable" to permi=
t the work "to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a pe=
riod of more than transitory duration." The second sentence makes clear tha=
t, in the case of "a work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are b=
eing transmitted," the work is regarded as "fixed" if a fixation is being m=
ade at the same time as the transmission.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under this definition "copies" and "phonorecords" to=
gether will comprise all of the material objects in which copyrightable wor=
ks are capable of being fixed. The definitions of these terms in section 10=
1, together with their usage in section 102 and throughout the bill, reflec=
t a fundamental distinction between the "original work" which is the produc=
t of "authorship" and the multitude of material objects in which it can be =
embodied. Thus, in the sense of the bill, a "book" is not a work of authors=
hip, but is a particular kind of "copy." Instead, the author may write a "l=
iterary work," which in turn can be embodied in a wide range of "copies" an=
d "phonorecords," including books, periodicals, computer punch cards, micro=
film, tape recordings, and so forth. It is possible to have an "original wo=
rk of authorship" without having a "copy" or "phonorecord" embodying it, an=
d it is also possible to have a "copy" or "phonorecord" embodying something=
 that does not qualify as an "original work of authorship." The two essenti=
al elements=E2=80=94original work and tangible object=E2=80=94must merge th=
rough fixation in order to produce subject matter copyrightable under the s=
tatute.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Categories of Copyrightable Works.</strong> =
The second sentence of section 102 lists seven broad categories which the c=
oncept of "works of authorship" is said to "include". The use of the word "=
include," as defined in section 101, makes clear that the listing is "illus=
trative and not limitative," and that the seven categories do not necessari=
ly exhaust the scope of "original works of authorship" that the bill is int=
ended to protect. Rather, the list sets out the general area of copyrightab=
le subject matter, but with sufficient flexibility to free the courts from =
rigid or outmoded concepts of the scope of particular categories. The items=
 are also overlapping in the sense that a work falling within one class may=
 encompass works coming within some or all of the other categories. In the =
aggregate, the list covers all classes of works now specified in section 5 =
of title 17 [section 5 of former title 17]; in addition, it specifically en=
umerates "pantomimes and choreographic works".</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Of the seven items listed, four are defined in secti=
on 101. The three undefined categories=E2=80=94"musical works," "dramatic w=
orks," and "pantomimes and choreographic works"=E2=80=94have fairly settled=
 meanings. There is no need, for example, to specify the copyrightability o=
f electronic or concrete music in the statute since the form of a work woul=
d no longer be of any importance, nor is it necessary to specify that "chor=
eographic works" do not include social dance steps and simple routines.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The four items defined in section 101 are "literary =
works," "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works," "motion pictures and au=
diovisual works", and "sound recordings". In each of these cases, definitio=
ns are needed not only because the meaning of the term itself is unsettled =
but also because the distinction between <!-- PDFPage:13 -->"work" and "mat=
erial object" requires clarification. The term "literary works" does not co=
nnote any criterion of literary merit or qualitative value: it includes cat=
alogs, directories, and similar factual, reference, or instructional works =
and compilations of data. It also includes computer data bases, and compute=
r programs to the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer=
's expression of original ideas, as distinguished from the ideas themselves=
.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Correspondingly, the definition of "pictorial, graph=
ic, and sculptural works" carries with it no implied criterion of artistic =
taste, aesthetic value, or intrinsic quality. The term is intended to compr=
ise not only "works of art" in the traditional sense but also works of grap=
hic art and illustration, art reproductions, plans and drawings, photograph=
s and reproductions of them, maps, charts, globes, and other cartographic w=
orks, works of these kinds intended for use in advertising and commerce, an=
d works of "applied art." There is no intention whatever to narrow the scop=
e of the subject matter now characterized in section 5(k) [section 5(k) of =
former title 17] as "prints or labels used for articles of merchandise." Ho=
wever, since this terminology suggests the material object in which a work =
is embodied rather than the work itself, the bill does not mention this cat=
egory separately.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in <=
i>Mazer v. Stein</i>, 347 U.S. 201 (1954) [74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L. Ed. 630, reh=
earing denied 74 S.Ct. 637, 347 U.S. 949, 98 L.Ed. 1096], works of "applied=
 art" encompass all original pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works that =
are intended to be or have been embodied in useful articles, regardless of =
factors such as mass production, commercial exploitation, and the potential=
 availability of design patent protection. The scope of exclusive rights in=
 these works is given special treatment in section 113, to be discussed bel=
ow.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee has added language to the definition o=
f "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" in an effort to make clearer t=
he distinction between works of applied art protectable under the bill and =
industrial designs not subject to copyright protection. The declaration tha=
t "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" include "works of artistic cra=
ftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian as=
pects are concerned" is classic language; it is drawn from Copyright Office=
 regulations promulgated in the 1940's and expressly endorsed by the Suprem=
e Court in the <i>Mazer</i> case.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The second part of the amendment states that "the de=
sign of a useful article *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* shall be considered a pictorial, g=
raphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such desig=
n incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be ident=
ified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the ut=
ilitarian aspects of the article." A "useful article" is defined as "an art=
icle having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray=
 the appearance of the article or to convey information." This part of the =
amendment is an adaptation of language added to the Copyright Office Regula=
tions in the mid-1950's in an effort to implement the Supreme Court's decis=
ion in the <i>Mazer</i> case.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In adopting this amendatory language, the Committee =
is seeking to draw as clear a line as possible between copyrightable works =
of applied art and uncopyrighted works of industrial design. A two-dimensio=
nal painting, drawing, or graphic work is still capable of being identified=
 as such when it is printed on or applied to utilitarian articles such as t=
extile fabrics, wallpaper, containers, and the like. The same is true when =
a statue or carving is used to embellish an industrial product or, as in th=
e <i>Mazer</i> case, is incorporated into a product without losing its abil=
ity to exist independently as a work of art. On the other hand, although th=
e shape of an industrial product may be aesthetically satisfying and valuab=
le, the Committee's intention is not to offer it copyright protection under=
 the bill. Unless the shape of an automobile, airplane, ladies' dress, food=
 processor, television set, or any other industrial product contains some e=
lement that, physically or conceptually, can be identified as separable fro=
m the utilitarian aspects of that article, the design would not be copyrigh=
ted under the bill. The test of separability and independence from "the uti=
litarian aspects of the article" does not depend upon the nature of the des=
ign=E2=80=94that is, even if the appearance of an article is determined by =
aesthetic (as opposed to functional) considerations, only elements, if any,=
 which can be identified separately from the useful article as such are cop=
yrightable. And, even if the three-dimensional design contains some such el=
ement (for example, a carving on the back of a chair or a floral relief des=
ign on silver flatware), copyright protection would extend only to that ele=
ment, and would not cover the over-all configuration of the utilitarian art=
icle as such.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">A special situation is presented by architectural wo=
rks. An architect's plans and drawings would, of course, be protected by co=
pyright, but the extent to which that protection would extend to the struct=
ure depicted would depend on the circumstances. Purely nonfunctional or mon=
umental structures would be subject to full copyright protection under the =
bill, and the same would be true of artistic sculpture or decorative orname=
ntation or embellishment added to a structure. On the other hand, where the=
 only elements of shape in an architectural design are conceptually insepar=
able from the utilitarian aspects of the structure, copyright protection fo=
r the design would not be available.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee has considered, but chosen to defer, t=
he possibility of protecting the design of typefaces. A "typeface" can be d=
efined as a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters, whose fo=
rms are related by repeating design elements consistently applied in a nota=
tional system and are intended to be embodied in articles whose intrinsic u=
tilitarian function is for use in composing text or other cognizable combin=
ations of characters. The Committee does not regard the design of typeface,=
 as thus defined, to be a copyrightable "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural =
work" within the meaning of this bill and the application of the dividing l=
ine in section 101.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Enactment of Public Law 92=E2=80=93140 in 1971 [Pub.=
 L. 92=E2=80=93140, Oct. 15, 1971, 85 Stat. 391, which amended sections 1, =
5, 19, 20, 26, and 101 of former title 17, and enacted provisions set out a=
s a note under section 1 of former title 17] marked the first recognition i=
n American copyright law of sound recordings as copyrightable works. As def=
ined in section 101, copyrightable "sound recordings" are original works of=
 authorship comprising an aggregate of musical, spoken, or other sounds tha=
t have been fixed in tangible form. The copyrightable work comprises the ag=
gregation of sounds and not the tangible medium of fixation. Thus, "sound r=
ecordings" as copyrightable subject matter are distinguished from "phonorec=
ords," the latter being physical objects in which sounds are fixed. They ar=
e also distinguished from any copyrighted literary, dramatic, or musical wo=
rks that may be reproduced on a "phonorecord."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">As a class of subject matter, sound recordings are c=
learly within the scope of the "writings of an author" capable of protectio=
n under the Constitution [Const. Art. I, =C2=A78, cl. 8], and the extension=
 of limited statutory protection to them was too long delayed. Aside from c=
ases in which sounds are fixed by some purely mechanical means without orig=
inality of any kind, the copyright protection that would prevent the reprod=
uction and distribution of unauthorized phonorecords of sound recordings is=
 clearly justified.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The copyrightable elements in a sound recording will=
 usually, though not always, involve "authorship" both on the part of the p=
erformers whose performance is captured and on the part of the record produ=
cer responsible for setting up the recording session, capturing and electro=
nically processing the sounds, and compiling and editing them to make the f=
inal sound recording. There may, however, be cases where the record produce=
r's contribution is so minimal that the performance is the only copyrightab=
le element in the work, and there may be cases (for example, recordings of =
birdcalls, <!-- PDFPage:14 -->sounds of racing cars, et cetera) where only =
the record producer's contribution is copyrightable.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Sound tracks of motion pictures, long a nebulous are=
a in American copyright law, are specifically included in the definition of=
 "motion pictures," and excluded in the definition of "sound recordings." T=
o be a "motion picture," as defined, requires three elements: (1) a series =
of images, (2) the capability of showing the images in certain successive o=
rder, and (3) an impression of motion when the images are thus shown. Coupl=
ed with the basic requirements of original authorship and fixation in tangi=
ble form, this definition encompasses a wide range of cinematographic works=
 embodied in films, tapes, video disks, and other media. However, it would =
not include: (1) unauthorized fixations of live performances or telecasts, =
(2) live telecasts that are not fixed simultaneously with their transmissio=
n, or (3) filmstrips and slide sets which, although consisting of a series =
of images intended to be shown in succession, are not capable of conveying =
an impression of motion.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">On the other hand, the bill equates audiovisual mate=
rials such as filmstrips, slide sets, and sets of transparencies with "moti=
on pictures" rather than with "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works." T=
heir sequential showing is closer to a "performance" than to a "display," a=
nd the definition of "audiovisual works," which applies also to "motion pic=
tures," embraces works consisting of a series of related images that are by=
 their nature, intended for showing by means of projectors or other devices=
.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Nature of Copyright.</strong> Copyright does=
 not preclude others from using the ideas or information revealed by the au=
thor's work. It pertains to the literary, musical, graphic, or artistic for=
m in which the author expressed intellectual concepts. Section 102(b) makes=
 clear that copyright protection does not extend to any idea, procedure, pr=
ocess, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regar=
dless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embo=
died in such work.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Some concern has been expressed lest copyright in co=
mputer programs should extend protection to the methodology or processes ad=
opted by the programmer, rather than merely to the "writing" expressing his=
 ideas. Section 102(b) is intended, among other things, to make clear that =
the expression adopted by the programmer is the copyrightable element in a =
computer program, and that the actual processes or methods embodied in the =
program are not within the scope of the copyright law.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the s=
cope of copyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to resta=
te, in the context of the new single Federal system of copyright, that the =
basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 103 complements section 102: A compilation o=
r derivative work is copyrightable if it represents an "original work of au=
thorship" and falls within one or more of the categories listed in section =
102. Read together, the two sections make plain that the criteria of copyri=
ghtable subject matter stated in section 102 apply with full force to works=
 that are entirely original and to those containing preexisting material. S=
ection 103(b) is also intended to define, more sharply and clearly than doe=
s section 7 of the present law [section 7 of former title 17], the importan=
t interrelationship and correlation between protection of preexisting and o=
f "new" material in a particular work. The most important point here is one=
 that is commonly misunderstood today: copyright in a "new version" covers =
only the material added by the later author, and has no effect one way or t=
he other on the copyright or public domain status of the preexisting materi=
al.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Between them the terms "compilations" and "derivativ=
e works" which are defined in section 101 comprehend every copyrightable wo=
rk that employs preexisting material or data of any kind. There is necessar=
ily some overlapping between the two, but they basically represent differen=
t concepts. A "compilation" results from a process of selecting, bringing t=
ogether, organizing, and arranging previously existing material of all kind=
s, regardless of whether the individual items in the material have been or =
ever could have been subject to copyright. A "derivative work," on the othe=
r hand, requires a process of recasting, transforming, or adapting "one or =
more preexisting works"; the "preexisting work" must come within the genera=
l subject matter of copyright set forth in section 102, regardless of wheth=
er it is or was ever copyrighted.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The second part of the sentence that makes up sectio=
n 103(a) deals with the status of a compilation or derivative work unlawful=
ly employing preexisting copyrighted material. In providing that protection=
 does not extend to "any part of the work in which such material has been u=
sed unlawfully," the bill prevents an infringer from benefiting, through co=
pyright protection, from committing an unlawful act, but preserves protecti=
on for those parts of the work that do not employ the preexisting work. Thu=
s, an unauthorized translation of a novel could not be copyrighted at all, =
but the owner of copyright in an anthology of poetry could sue someone who =
infringed the whole anthology, even though the infringer proves that public=
ation of one of the poems was unauthorized. Under this provision, copyright=
 could be obtained as long as the use of the preexisting work was not "unla=
wful," even though the consent of the copyright owner had not been obtained=
. For instance, the unauthorized reproduction of a work might be "lawful" u=
nder the doctrine of fair use or an applicable foreign law, and if so the w=
ork incorporating it could be copyrighted.</p>

<p class=3D"note-body">Section 104 of the bill [this section], which sets f=
orth the basic criteria under which works of foreign origin can be protecte=
d under the U.S. copyright law, divides all works coming within the scope o=
f sections 102 and 103 into two categories: unpublished and published. Subs=
ection (a) imposes no qualifications of nationality and domicile with respe=
ct to unpublished works. Subsection (b) would make published works subject =
to protection under any one of four conditions:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(1) The author is a national or domiciliary of t=
he United States or of a country with which the United States has copyright=
 relations under a treaty, or is a stateless person;</p>

</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(3) The work is first published by the United Na=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Scope of the Prohibition.</strong> The basic=
 premise of section 105 of the bill is the same as that of section 8 of the=
 present law [section 8 of former title 17]=E2=80=94that works produced for=
 the U.S. Government by its officers and employees should not be subject to=
 copyright. The provision applies the principle equally to unpublished and =
published works.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The general prohibition against copyright in section=
 105 applies to "any work of the United States Government," which is define=
d in section 101 as "a work prepared by an officer or employee of the Unite=
d States Government as part of that person's official duties." Under this d=
efinition a Government official or employee would not be prevented from sec=
uring copyright in a work written at that person's own volition and outside=
 his or her duties, even though the subject matter involves the Government =
work or professional field of the official or employee. Although the wordin=
g of the definition of "work of the United States Government" differs somew=
hat from that of the definition of "work made for hire," the concepts are i=
ntended to be construed in the same way.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">A more difficult and far-reaching problem is whether=
 the definition should be broadened to prohibit copyright in works prepared=
 under U.S. Government contract or grant. As the bill is written, the Gover=
nment agency concerned could determine in each case whether to allow an ind=
ependent contractor or grantee, to secure copyright in works prepared in wh=
ole or in part with the use of Government funds. The argument that has been=
 made against allowing copyright in this situation is that the public shoul=
d not be required to pay a "double subsidy," and that it is inconsistent to=
 prohibit copyright in works by Government employees while permitting priva=
te copyrights in a growing body of works created by persons who are paid wi=
th Government funds. Those arguing in favor of potential copyright protecti=
on have stressed the importance of copyright as an incentive to creation an=
d dissemination in this situation, and the basically different policy consi=
derations, applicable to works written by Government employees and those ap=
plicable to works prepared by private organizations with the use of Federal=
 funds.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The bill deliberately avoids making any sort of outr=
ight, unqualified prohibition against copyright in works prepared under Gov=
ernment contract or grant. There may well be cases where it would be in the=
 public interest to deny copyright in the writings generated by Government =
research contracts and the like; it can be assumed that, where a Government=
 agency commissions a work for its own use merely as an alternative to havi=
ng one of its own employees prepare the work, the right to secure a private=
 copyright would be withheld. However, there are almost certainly many othe=
r cases where the denial of copyright protection would be unfair or would h=
amper the production and publication of important works. Where, under the p=
articular circumstances, Congress or the agency involved finds that the nee=
d to have a work freely available outweighs the need of the private author =
to secure copyright, the problem can be dealt with by specific legislation,=
 agency regulations, or contractual restrictions.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The prohibition on copyright protection for United S=
tates Government works is not intended to have any effect on protection of =
these works abroad. Works of the governments of most other countries are co=
pyrighted. There are no valid policy reasons for denying such protection to=
 United States Government works in foreign countries, or for precluding the=
 Government from making licenses for the use of its works abroad.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:21 --><p class=3D"note-body">The effect of section 105 is inte=
nded to place all works of the United States Government, published or unpub=
lished, in the public domain. This means that the individual Government off=
icial or employee who wrote the work could not secure copyright in it or re=
strain its dissemination by the Government or anyone else, but it also mean=
s that, as far as the copyright law is concerned, the Government could not =
restrain the employee or official from disseminating the work if he or she =
chooses to do so. The use of the term "work of the United States Government=
" does not mean that a work falling within the definition of that term is t=
he property of the U.S. Government.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">limited exception for national technical informatio=
n service</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">At the House hearings in 1975 the U.S. Department of=
 Commerce called attention to its National Technical Information Service (N=
TIS), which has a statutory mandate, under Chapter 23 [=C2=A71151 et seq.] =
of Title 15 of the U.S. Code, to operate a clearinghouse for the collection=
 and dissemination of scientific, technical and engineering information. Un=
der its statute, NTIS is required to be as self-sustaining as possible, and=
 not to force the general public to bear publishing costs that are for priv=
ate benefit. The Department urged an amendment to section 105 that would al=
low it to secure copyright in NTIS publications both in the United States a=
nd abroad, noting that a precedent exists in the Standard Reference Data Ac=
t (15 U.S.C. =C2=A7290(e) [=C2=A7290e]).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In response to this request the Committee adopted a =
limited exception to the general prohibition in section 105, permitting the=
 Secretary of Commerce to "secure copyright for a limited term not to excee=
d five years, on behalf of the United States as author or copyright owner" =
in any NTIS publication disseminated pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Chapter 23 [=C2=
=A71151 et seq.]. In order to "secure copyright" in a work under this amend=
ment the Secretary would be required to publish the work with a copyright n=
otice, and the five-year term would begin upon the date of first publicatio=
n.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Proposed Saving Clause.</strong> Section 8 o=
f the statute now in effect [section 8 of former title 17] includes a savin=
g clause intended to make clear that the copyright protection of a private =
work is not affected if the work is published by the Government. This provi=
sion serves a real purpose in the present law because of the ambiguity of t=
he undefined term "any publication of the United States Government." Sectio=
n 105 of the bill, however, uses the operative term "work of the United Sta=
tes Government" and defines it in such a way that privately written works a=
re clearly excluded from the prohibition; accordingly, a saving clause beco=
mes superfluous.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Retention of a saving clause has been urged on the g=
round that the present statutory provision is frequently cited, and that ha=
ving the provision expressly stated in the law would avoid questions and ex=
planations. The committee here observes: (1) there is nothing in section 10=
5 that would relieve the Government of its obligation to secure permission =
in order to publish a copyrighted work; and (2) publication or other use by=
 the Government of a private work would not affect its copyright protection=
 in any way. The question of use of copyrighted material in documents publi=
shed by the Congress and its Committees is discussed below in connection wi=
th section 107.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Works of the United States Postal Service.</=
strong> The intent of section 105 [this section] is to restrict the prohibi=
tion against Government copyright to works written by employees of the Unit=
ed States Government within the scope of their official duties. In accordan=
ce with the objectives of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 [Pub. L. 91=
=E2=80=93375, which enacted title 39, Postal Service], this section does no=
t apply to works created by employees of the United States Postal Service. =
In addition to enforcing the criminal statutes proscribing the forgery or c=
ounterfeiting of postage stamps, the Postal Service could, if it chooses, u=
se the copyright law to prevent the reproduction of postage stamp designs f=
or private or commercial non-postal services (for example, in philatelic pu=
blications and catalogs, in general advertising, in art reproductions, in t=
extile designs, and so forth). However, any copyright claimed by the Postal=
 Service in its works, including postage stamp designs, would be subject to=
 the same conditions, formalities, and time limits as other copyrightable w=
orks.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>General Scope of Copyright.</strong> The fiv=
e fundamental rights that the bill gives to copyright owners=E2=80=94the ex=
clusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, publication, performance, and d=
isplay=E2=80=94are stated generally in section 106. These exclusive rights,=
 which comprise the so-called "bundle of rights" that is a copyright, are c=
umulative and may overlap in some cases. Each of the five enumerated rights=
 may be subdivided indefinitely and, as discussed below in connection with =
section 201, each subdivision of an exclusive right may be owned and enforc=
ed separately.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The approach of the bill is to set forth the copyrig=
ht owner's exclusive rights in broad terms in section 106, and then to prov=
ide various limitations, qualifications, or exemptions in the 12 sections t=
hat follow. Thus, everything in section 106 is made "subject to sections 10=
7 through 118", and must be read in conjunction with those provisions.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The exclusive rights accorded to a copyright owner u=
nder section 106 are "to do and to authorize" any of the activities specifi=
ed in the five numbered clauses. Use of the phrase "to authorize" is intend=
ed to avoid any questions as to the liability of contributory infringers. F=
or example, a person who lawfully acquires an authorized copy of a motion p=
icture would be an infringer if he or she engages in the business of rentin=
g it to others for purposes of unauthorized public performance.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Rights of Reproduction, Adaptation, and Publ=
ication.</strong> The first three clauses of section 106, which cover all <=
!-- PDFPage:22 -->rights under a copyright except those of performance and =
display, extend to every kind of copyrighted work. The exclusive rights enc=
ompassed by these clauses, though closely related, are independent; they ca=
n generally be characterized as rights of copying, recording, adaptation, a=
nd publishing. A single act of infringement may violate all of these rights=
 at once, as where a publisher reproduces, adapts, and sells copies of a pe=
rson's copyrighted work as part of a publishing venture. Infringement takes=
 place when any one of the rights is violated: where, for example, a printe=
r reproduces copies without selling them or a retailer sells copies without=
 having anything to do with their reproduction. The references to "copies o=
r phonorecords," although in the plural, are intended here and throughout t=
he bill to include the singular (1 U.S.C. =C2=A71).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Reproduction</i>.=E2=80=94Read together with the =
relevant definitions in section 101, the right "to reproduce the copyrighte=
d work in copies or phonorecords" means the right to produce a material obj=
ect in which the work is duplicated, transcribed, imitated, or simulated in=
 a fixed form from which it can be "perceived, reproduced, or otherwise com=
municated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device." As unde=
r the present law, a copyrighted work would be infringed by reproducing it =
in whole or in any substantial part, and by duplicating it exactly or by im=
itation or simulation. Wide departures or variations from the copyrighted w=
ork would still be an infringement as long as the author's "expression" rat=
her than merely the author's "ideas" are taken. An exception to this genera=
l principle, applicable to the reproduction of copyrighted sound recordings=
, is specified in section 114.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">"Reproduction" under clause (1) of section 106 is to=
 be distinguished from "display" under clause (5). For a work to be "reprod=
uced," its fixation in tangible form must be "sufficiently permanent or sta=
ble to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for=
 a period of more than transitory duration." Thus, the showing of images on=
 a screen or tube would not be a violation of clause (1), although it might=
 come within the scope of clause (5).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Preparation of Derivative Works</i>.=E2=80=94The =
exclusive right to prepare derivative works, specified separately in clause=
 (2) of section 106, overlaps the exclusive right of reproduction to some e=
xtent. It is broader than that right, however, in the sense that reproducti=
on requires fixation in copies or phonorecords, whereas the preparation of =
a derivative work, such as a ballet, pantomime, or improvised performance, =
may be an infringement even though nothing is ever fixed in tangible form.<=
/p>
<p class=3D"note-body">To be an infringement the "derivative work" must be =
"based upon the copyrighted work," and the definition in section 101 refers=
 to "a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, m=
otion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, conde=
nsation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or a=
dapted." Thus, to constitute a violation of section 106(2), the infringing =
work must incorporate a portion of the copyrighted work in some form; for e=
xample, a detailed commentary on a work or a programmatic musical compositi=
on inspired by a novel would not normally constitute infringements under th=
is clause.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Use in Information Storage and Retrieval Systems<=
/i>.=E2=80=94As section 117 declares explicitly, the bill is not intended t=
o alter the present law with respect to the use of copyrighted works in com=
puter systems.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Public Distribution</i>.=E2=80=94Clause (3) of se=
ction 106 establishes the exclusive right of publication: The right "to dis=
tribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sal=
e or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." Under t=
his provision the copyright owner would have the right to control the first=
 public distribution of an authorized copy or phonorecord of his work, whet=
her by sale, gift, loan, or some rental or lease arrangement. Likewise, any=
 unauthorized public distribution of copies or phonorecords that were unlaw=
fully made would be an infringement. As section 109 makes clear, however, t=
he copyright owner's rights under section 106(3) cease with respect to a pa=
rticular copy or phonorecord once he has parted with ownership of it.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Rights of Public Performance and Display. <i=
>Performing Rights and the "For Profit" Limitation</i></strong>.=E2=80=94Th=
e right of public performance under section 106(4) extends to "literary, mu=
sical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures a=
nd other audiovisual works and sound recordings" and, unlike the equivalent=
 provisions now in effect, is not limited by any "for profit" requirement. =
The approach of the bill, as in many foreign laws, is first to state the pu=
blic performance right in broad terms, and then to provide specific exempti=
ons for educational and other nonprofit uses.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">This approach is more reasonable than the outright e=
xemption of the 1909 statute. The line between commercial and "nonprofit" o=
rganizations is increasingly difficult to draw. Many "non-profit" organizat=
ions are highly subsidized and capable of paying royalties, and the widespr=
ead public exploitation of copyrighted works by public broadcasters and oth=
er noncommercial organizations is likely to grow. In addition to these tren=
ds, it is worth noting that performances and displays are continuing to sup=
plant markets for printed copies and that in the future a broad "not for pr=
ofit" exemption could not only hurt authors but could dry up their incentiv=
e to write.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The exclusive right of public performance is expande=
d to include not only motion pictures, including works recorded on film, vi=
deo tape, and video disks, but also audiovisual works such as filmstrips an=
d sets of slides. This provision of section 106(4), which is consistent wit=
h the assimilation of motion pictures to audiovisual works throughout the b=
ill, is also related to amendments of the definitions of "display" and "per=
form" discussed below. The important issue of performing rights in sound re=
cordings is discussed in connection with section 114.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Right of Public Display</i>.=E2=80=94Clause (5) o=
f section 106 represents the first explicit statutory recognition in Americ=
an copyright law of an exclusive right to show a copyrighted work, or an im=
age of it, to the public. The existence or extent of this right under the p=
resent statute is uncertain and subject to challenge. The bill would give t=
he owners of copyright in "literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic w=
orks, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works", including t=
he individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, the exc=
lusive right "to display the copyrighted work publicly."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Definitions.</strong> Under the definitions =
of "perform," "display," "publicly," and "transmit" in section 101, the con=
cepts of public performance and public display cover not only the initial r=
endition or showing, but also any further act by which that rendition or sh=
owing is transmitted or communicated to the public. Thus, for example: a si=
nger is performing when he or she sings a song; a broadcasting network is p=
erforming when it transmits his or her performance (whether simultaneously =
or from records); a local broadcaster is performing when it transmits the n=
etwork broadcast; a cable television system is performing when it retransmi=
ts the broadcast to its subscribers; and any individual is performing whene=
ver he or she plays a phonorecord embodying the performance or communicates=
 the performance by turning on a receiving set. Although any act by which t=
he initial performance or display is transmitted, repeated, or made to recu=
r would itself be a "performance" or "display" under the bill, it would not=
 be actionable as an infringement unless it were done "publicly," as define=
d in section 101. Certain other performances and displays, in addition to t=
hose that are "private," are exempted or given qualified copyright control =
under sections 107 through 118.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">To "perform" a work, under the definition in section=
 101, includes reading a literary work aloud, singing or playing music, dan=
cing a ballet or other choreographic work, and acting out a dramatic work o=
r pantomime. A <!-- PDFPage:23 -->performance may be accomplished "either d=
irectly or by means of any device or process," including all kinds of equip=
ment for reproducing or amplifying sounds or visual images, any sort of tra=
nsmitting apparatus, any type of electronic retrieval system, and any other=
 techniques and systems not yet in use or even invented.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The definition of "perform" in relation to "a motion=
 picture or other audiovisual work" is "to show its images in any sequence =
or to make the sounds accompanying it audible." The showing of portions of =
a motion picture, filmstrip, or slide set must therefore be sequential to c=
onstitute a "performance" rather than a "display", but no particular order =
need be maintained. The purely aural performance of a motion picture sound =
track, or of the sound portions of an audiovisual work, would constitute a =
performance of the "motion picture or other audiovisual work"; but, where s=
ome of the sounds have been reproduced separately on phonorecords, a perfor=
mance from the phonorecord would not constitute performance of the motion p=
icture or audiovisual work.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The corresponding definition of "display" covers any=
 showing of a "copy" of the work, "either directly or by means of a film, s=
lide, television image, or any other device or process." Since "copies" are=
 defined as including the material object "in which the work is first fixed=
," the right of public display applies to original works of art as well as =
to reproductions of them. With respect to motion pictures and other audiovi=
sual works, it is a "display" (rather than a "performance") to show their "=
individual images nonsequentially." In addition to the direct showings of a=
 copy of a work, "display" would include the projection of an image on a sc=
reen or other surface by any method, the transmission of an image by electr=
onic or other means, and the showing of an image on a cathode ray tube, or =
similar viewing apparatus connected with any sort of information storage an=
d retrieval system.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under clause (1) of the definition of "publicly" in =
section 101, a performance or display is "public" if it takes place "at a p=
lace open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of perso=
ns outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is g=
athered." One of the principal purposes of the definition was to make clear=
 that, contrary to the decision in <i>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distributing Corp=
. v. Wyatt</i>, 21 C.O.Bull. 203 (D.Md.1932), performances in "semipublic" =
places such as clubs, lodges, factories, summer camps, and schools are "pub=
lic performances" subject to copyright control. The term "a family" in this=
 context would include an individual living alone, so that a gathering conf=
ined to the individual's social acquaintances would normally be regarded as=
 private. Routine meetings of businesses and governmental personnel would b=
e excluded because they do not represent the gathering of a "substantial nu=
mber of persons."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (2) of the definition of "publicly" in sectio=
n 101 makes clear that the concepts of public performance and public displa=
y include not only performances and displays that occur initially in a publ=
ic place, but also acts that transmit or otherwise communicate a performanc=
e or display of the work to the public by means of any device or process. T=
he definition of "transmit"=E2=80=94to communicate a performance or display=
 "by any device or process whereby images or sound are received beyond the =
place from which they are sent"=E2=80=94is broad enough to include all conc=
eivable forms and combinations of wired or wireless communications media, i=
ncluding but by no means limited to radio and television broadcasting as we=
 know them. Each and every method by which the images or sounds comprising =
a performance or display are picked up and conveyed is a "transmission," an=
d if the transmission reaches the public in my [any] form, the case comes w=
ithin the scope of clauses (4) or (5) of section 106.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the bill, as under the present law, a performa=
nce made available by transmission to the public at large is "public" even =
though the recipients are not gathered in a single place, and even if there=
 is no proof that any of the potential recipients was operating his receivi=
ng apparatus at the time of the transmission. The same principles apply whe=
never the potential recipients of the transmission represent a limited segm=
ent of the public, such as the occupants of hotel rooms or the subscribers =
of a cable television service. Clause (2) of the definition of "publicly" i=
s applicable "whether the members of the public capable of receiving the pe=
rformance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and=
 at the same time or at different times."</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>General Background of the Problem.</strong> =
The judicial doctrine of fair use, one of the most important and well-estab=
lished limitations on the exclusive right of copyright owners, would be giv=
en express statutory recognition for the first time in section 107. The cla=
im that a defendant's acts constituted a fair use rather than an infringeme=
nt has been raised as a defense in innumerable copyright actions over the y=
ears, and there is ample case law recognizing the existence of the doctrine=
 and applying it. The examples enumerated at page 24 of the Register's 1961=
 Report, while by no means exhaustive, give some idea of the sort of activi=
ties the courts might regard as fair use under the circumstances: "quotatio=
n of excerpts in a review or criticism for purposes of illustration or comm=
ent; quotation of short passages in a scholarly or technical work, for illu=
stration or clarification of the author's observations; use in a parody of =
some of the content of the work parodied; summary of an address or article,=
 with brief quotations, in a news report; reproduction by a library of a po=
rtion of a work to replace part of a damaged copy; reproduction by a teache=
r or student of a small part of a work to illustrate a lesson; reproduction=
 of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports; incidental an=
d fortuitous reproduction, in a newsreel or broadcast, of a work located in=
 the scene of an event being reported."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Although the courts have considered and ruled upon t=
he fair use doctrine over and over again, no real definition of the concept=
 has ever emerged. Indeed, since the doctrine is an equitable rule of reaso=
n, no generally applicable definition is possible, and each case raising th=
e question must be decided on its own facts. On the other hand, the courts =
have evolved a set of criteria which, though in no case definitive or deter=
minative, provide some gauge for balancing the equities. These criteria hav=
e been stated in various ways, but essentially they can all be reduced to t=
he four standards which have been adopted in section 107: "(1) the purpose =
and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nat=
ure or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrig=
hted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relatio=
n to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon th=
e potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">These criteria are relevant in determining whether t=
he basic doctrine of fair use, as stated in the first sentence of section 1=
07, applies in a particular case: "Not<!-- PDFPage:26 -->withstanding the p=
rovisions of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including suc=
h use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means speci=
fied by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporti=
ng, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or=
 research, is not an infringement of copyright."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The specific wording of section 107 as it now stands=
 is the result of a process of accretion, resulting from the long controver=
sy over the related problems of fair use and the reproduction (mostly by ph=
otocopying) of copyrighted material for educational and scholarly purposes.=
 For example, the reference to fair use "by reproduction in copies or phono=
records or by any other means" is mainly intended to make clear that the do=
ctrine has as much application to photocopying and taping as to older forms=
 of use; it is not intended to give these kinds of reproduction any special=
 status under the fair use provision or to sanction any reproduction beyond=
 the normal and reasonable limits of fair use. Similarly, the newly-added r=
eference to "multiple copies for classroom use" is a recognition that, unde=
r the proper circumstances of fairness, the doctrine can be applied to repr=
oductions of multiple copies for the members of a class.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee has amended the first of the criteria =
to be considered=E2=80=94"the purpose and character of the use"=E2=80=94to =
state explicitly that this factor includes a consideration of "whether such=
 use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes." =
This amendment is not intended to be interpreted as any sort of not-for-pro=
fit limitation on educational uses of copyrighted works. It is an express r=
ecognition that, as under the present law, the commercial or non-profit cha=
racter of an activity, while not conclusive with respect to fair use, can a=
nd should be weighed along with other factors in fair use decisions.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>General Intention Behind the Provision.</str=
ong> The statement of the fair use doctrine in section 107 offers some guid=
ance to users in determining when the principles of the doctrine apply. How=
ever, the endless variety of situations and combinations of circumstances t=
hat can rise in particular cases precludes the formulation of exact rules i=
n the statute. The bill endorses the purpose and general scope of the judic=
ial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrin=
e in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological change.=
 Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of =
the criteria applicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the doctrin=
e to particular situations on a case-by-case basis. Section 107 is intended=
 to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narro=
w, or enlarge it in any way.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Intention as to Classroom Reproduction.</str=
ong> Although the works and uses to which the doctrine of fair use is appli=
cable are as broad as the copyright law itself, most of the discussion of s=
ection 107 has centered around questions of classroom reproduction, particu=
larly photocopying. The arguments on the question are summarized at pp. 30=
=E2=80=9331 of this Committee's 1967 report (H.R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., =
1st Sess.), and have not changed materially in the intervening years.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee also adheres to its earlier conclusion=
, that "a specific exemption freeing certain reproductions of copyrighted w=
orks for educational and scholarly purposes from copyright control is not j=
ustified." At the same time the Committee recognizes, as it did in 1967, th=
at there is a "need for greater certainty and protection for teachers." In =
an effort to meet this need the Committee has not only adopted further amen=
dments to section 107, but has also amended section 504(c) to provide innoc=
ent teachers and other non-profit users of copyrighted material with broad =
insulation against unwarranted liability for infringement. The latter amend=
ments are discussed below in connection with Chapter 5 of the bill [=C2=A75=
01 et seq. of this title].</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In 1967 the Committee also sought to approach this p=
roblem by including, in its report, a very thorough discussion of "the cons=
iderations lying behind the four criteria listed in the amended section 107=
, in the context of typical classroom situations arising today." This discu=
ssion appeared on pp. 32=E2=80=9335 of the 1967 report, and with some chang=
es has been retained in the Senate report on S. 22 (S. Rep. No. 94=E2=80=93=
473, pp. 63=E2=80=9365). The Committee has reviewed this discussion, and co=
nsiders that it still has value as an analysis of various aspects of the pr=
oblem.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">At the Judiciary Subcommittee hearings in June 1975,=
 Chairman Kastenmeier and other members urged the parties to meet together =
independently in an effort to achieve a meeting of the minds as to permissi=
ble educational uses of copyrighted material. The response to these suggest=
ions was positive, and a number of meetings of three groups, dealing respec=
tively with classroom reproduction of printed material, music, and audio-vi=
sual material, were held beginning in September 1975.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In a joint letter to Chairman Kastenmeier, dated Mar=
ch 19, 1976, the representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee of Educational Ins=

periodicals under Section 107 of H.R. 2223 and S. 22 [this section], and th=
at as part of that tentative agreement each side would accept the amendment=
s to Sections 107 and 504 [this section and section 504 of this title] whic=
h were adopted by your Subcommittee on March 3, 1976.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">We are now happy to tell you that the agreement =
has been approved by the principals and we enclose a copy herewith. We had =
originally intended to translate the agreement into language suitable for i=

cessary.</p>

rote to Chairman Kastenmeier as follows:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">During the hearings on H.R. 2223 in June 1975, y=

<p class=3D"note-body-1em">Representatives of music educators and music pub=

</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">We are very pleased to inform you that the discu=

o the copyright of the music itself and not to any copyright which may exis=

<p class=3D"note-body-1em">1. Copying to create or replace or substitute fo=

<p class=3D"note-body-1em">2. Copying of or from works intended to be "cons=

<p class=3D"note-body-1em">5. Copying without inclusion of the copyright no=
tice which appears on the printed copy.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The problem of off-the-air taping for nonprofit clas=
sroom use of copyrighted audiovisual works incorporated in radio and televi=
sion broadcasts has proved to be difficult to resolve. The Committee believ=
es that the fair use doctrine has some limited application in this area, bu=
t it appears that the development of detailed guidelines will require a mor=
e thorough exploration than has so far been possible of the needs and probl=
ems of a number of different interests affected, and of the various legal p=
roblems presented. Nothing in section 107 or elsewhere in the bill is inten=
ded to change or prejudge the law on the point. On the other hand, the Comm=
ittee is sensitive to the importance of the problem, and urges the represen=
tatives of the various interests, if possible under the leadership of the R=
egister of Copyrights, to continue their discussions actively and in a cons=
tructive spirit. If it would be helpful to a solution, the Committee is rec=
eptive to undertaking further consideration of the problem in a future Cong=
ress.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee appreciates and commends the efforts a=
nd the cooperative and reasonable spirit of the parties who achieved the ag=
reed guidelines on books and periodicals and on music. Representatives of t=
he American Association of University Professors and of the Association of =
American Law Schools have written to the Committee strongly criticizing the=
 guidelines, particularly with respect to multiple copying, as being too re=
strictive with respect to classroom situations at the university and gradua=
te level. However, the Committee notes that the Ad Hoc group did include re=
presentatives of higher education, that the stated "purpose of the *&nbsp;*=
&nbsp;* guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of=
 educational fair use" and that the agreement acknowledges "there may be in=
stances in which copying which does not fall within the guidelines *&nbsp;*=
&nbsp;* may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee believes the guidelines are a reasonab=
le interpretation of the minimum standards of fair use. Teachers will know =
that copying within the guidelines is fair use. Thus, the guidelines serve =
the purpose of fulfilling the need for greater certainty and protection for=
 teachers. The Committee expresses the hope that if there are areas where s=
tandards other than these guidelines may be appropriate, the parties will c=
ontinue their efforts to provide additional specific guidelines in the same=
 spirit of good will and give and take that has marked the discussion of th=
is subject in recent months.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Reproduction and Uses for Other Purposes.</s=
trong> The concentrated attention given the fair use provision in the conte=
xt of classroom teaching activities should not obscure its application in o=
ther areas. It must be emphasized again that the same general standards of =
fair use are applicable to all kinds of uses of copyrighted material, altho=
ugh the relative weight to be given them will differ from case to case.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The fair use doctrine would be relevant to the use o=
f excerpts from copyrighted works in educational broadcasting activities no=
t exempted under section 110(2) or 112, and not covered by the licensing pr=
ovisions of section 118. In these cases the factors to be weighed in applyi=
ng the criteria of this section would include whether the performers, produ=
cers, directors, and others responsible for the broadcast were paid, the si=
ze and nature of the audience, the size and number of excerpts taken and, i=
n the case of recordings made for broadcast, the number of copies reproduce=
d and the extent of their reuse or exchange. The availability of the fair u=
se doctrine to educational broadcasters would be narrowly circumscribed in =
the case of motion pictures and other audiovisual works, but under appropri=
ate circumstances it could apply to the nonsequential showing of an individ=
ual still or slide, or to the performance of a short excerpt from a motion =
picture for criticism or comment.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Another special instance illustrating the applicatio=
n of the fair use doctrine pertains to the making of copies or phonorecords=
 of works in the special forms needed for the use of blind persons. These s=
pecial forms, such as copies in Braille and phonorecords of oral readings (=
talking books), are not usually made by the publishers for commercial distr=
ibution. For the most part, such copies and phonorecords are made by the Li=
brary of Congress' Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped with p=
ermission obtained from the copyright owners, and are circulated to blind p=
ersons through regional libraries covering the nation. In addition, such co=
pies and phonorecords are made locally by individual volunteers for the use=
 of blind persons in their communities, and the Library of Congress conduct=
s a program for training such volunteers. While the making of multiple copi=
es or phonorecords of a work for general circulation requires the permissio=
n of the copyright owner, a problem addressed in section 710 of the bill, t=
he making of a single copy or phonorecord by an individual as a free servic=
e for blind persons would properly be considered a fair use under section 1=
07.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">A problem of particular urgency is that of preservin=
g for posterity prints of motion pictures made before 1942. Aside from the =
deplorable fact that in a great many cases the only existing copy of a film=
 has been deliberately destroyed, those that remain are in immediate danger=
 of disintegration; they were printed on film stock with a nitrate base tha=
t will inevitably decompose in time. The efforts of the Library of Congress=
, the American Film Institute, and other organizations to rescue and preser=
ve this irreplaceable contribution to our cultural life are to be applauded=
, and the making of duplicate copies for purposes of archival preservation =
certainly falls within the scope of "fair use."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">When a copyrighted work contains unfair, inaccurate,=
 or derogatory information concerning an individual or institution, the ind=
ividual or institution may copy and reproduce such parts of the work as are=
 necessary to permit understandable comment on the statements made in the w=
ork.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:29 --><p class=3D"note-body">The Committee has considered the =
question of publication, in Congressional hearings and documents, of copyri=
ghted material. Where the length of the work or excerpt published and the n=
umber of copies authorized are reasonable under the circumstances, and the =
work itself is directly relevant to a matter of legitimate legislative conc=
ern, the Committee believes that the publication would constitute fair use.=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">During the consideration of the revision bill in the=
 94th Congress it was proposed that independent newsletters, as distinguish=
ed from house organs and publicity or advertising publications, be given se=
parate treatment. It is argued that newsletters are particularly vulnerable=
 to mass photocopying, and that most newsletters have fairly modest circula=
tions. Whether the copying of portions of a newsletter is an act of infring=
ement or a fair use will necessarily turn on the facts of the individual ca=
se. However, as a general principle, it seems clear that the scope of the f=
air use doctrine should be considerably narrower in the case of newsletters=
 than in that of either mass-circulation periodicals or scientific journals=
. The commercial nature of the user is a significant factor in such cases: =
Copying by a profit-making user of even a small portion of a newsletter may=
 have a significant impact on the commercial market for the work.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee has examined the use of excerpts from =
copyrighted works in the art work of calligraphers. The committee believes =
that a single copy reproduction of an excerpt from a copyrighted work by a =
calligrapher for a single client does not represent an infringement of copy=
right. Likewise, a single reproduction of excerpts from a copyrighted work =
by a student calligrapher or teacher in a learning situation would be a fai=
r use of the copyrighted work.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Register of Copyrights has recommended that the =
committee report describe the relationship between this section and the pro=
visions of section 108 relating to reproduction by libraries and archives. =
The doctrine of fair use applies to library photocopying, and nothing conta=
ined in section 108 "in any way affects the right of fair use." No provisio=
n of section 108 is intended to take away any rights existing under the fai=
r use doctrine. To the contrary, section 108 authorizes certain photocopyin=
g practices which may not qualify as a fair use.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The criteria of fair use are necessarily set forth i=
n general terms. In the application of the criteria of fair use to specific=
 photocopying practices of libraries, it is the intent of this legislation =
to provide an appropriate balancing of the rights of creators, and the need=
s of users.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Notwithstanding the exclusive rights of the owners o=
f copyright, section 108 provides that under certain conditions it is not a=
n infringement of copyright for a library or archives, or any of its employ=
ees acting within the scope of their employment, to reproduce or distribute=
 not more than one copy or phonorecord of a work, provided (1) the reproduc=
tion or distribution is made without any purpose of direct or indirect comm=
ercial advantage and (2) the collections of the library or archives are ope=
n to the public or available not only to researchers affiliated with the li=
brary or archives, but <!-- PDFPage:31 -->also to other persons doing resea=
rch in a specialized field, and (3) the reproduction or distribution of the=
 work includes a notice of copyright.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under this provision, a purely commercial enterprise=
 could not establish a collection of copyrighted works, call itself a libra=
ry or archive, and engage in for-profit reproduction and distribution of ph=
otocopies. Similarly, it would not be possible for a non-profit institution=
, by means of contractual arrangements with a commercial copying enterprise=
, to authorize the enterprise to carry out copying and distribution functio=
ns that would be exempt if conducted by the non-profit institution itself.<=
/p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The reference to "indirect commercial advantage" has=
 raised questions as to the status of photocopying done by or for libraries=
 or archival collections within industrial, profit-making, or proprietary i=
nstitutions (such as the research and development departments of chemical, =
pharmaceutical, automobile, and oil corporations, the library of a propriet=
ary hospital, the collections owned by a law or medical partnership, etc.).=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">There is a direct interrelationship between this pro=
blem and the prohibitions against "multiple" and "systematic" photocopying =
in section 108(g)(1) and (2). Under section 108, a library in a profitmakin=
g organization would not be authorized to:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(a) use a single subscription or copy to supply =
its employees with multiple copies of material relevant to their work; or</=
p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(b) use a single subscription or copy to supply =
its employees, on request, with single copies of material relevant to their=
 work, where the arrangement is ''systematic" in the sense of deliberately =
substituting photocopying for subscription or purchase; or</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(c) use "interlibrary loan" arrangements for obt=
aining photocopies in such aggregate quantities as to substitute for subscr=
iptions or purchase of material needed by employees in their work.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-block">Moreover, a library in a profit-making organiz=
ation could not evade these obligations by installing reproducing equipment=
 on its premises for unsupervised use by the organization's staff.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Isolated, spontaneous making of single photocopies b=
y a library in a for-profit organization, without any systematic effort to =
substitute photocopying for subscriptions or purchases, would be covered by=
 section 108, even though the copies are furnished to the employees of the =
organization for use in their work. Similarly, for-profit libraries could p=
articipate in interlibrary arrangements for exchange of photocopies, as lon=
g as the reproduction or distribution was not "systematic." These activitie=
s, by themselves, would ordinarily not be considered "for direct or indirec=
t commercial advantage," since the "advantage" referred to in this clause m=
ust attach to the immediate commercial motivation behind the reproduction o=
r distribution itself, rather than to the ultimate profit-making motivation=
 behind the enterprise in which the library is located. On the other hand, =
section 108 would not excuse reproduction or distribution if there were a c=
ommercial motive behind the actual making or distributing of the copies, if=
 multiple copies were made or distributed, or if the photocopying activitie=
s were "systematic" in the sense that their aim was to substitute for subsc=
riptions or purchases.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The rights of reproduction and distribution under se=
ction 108 apply in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Archival Reproduction.</strong> Subsection (=
b) authorizes the reproduction and distribution of a copy or phonorecord of=
 an unpublished work duplicated in facsimile form solely for purposes of pr=
eservation and security, or for deposit for research use in another library=
 or archives, if the copy or phonorecord reproduced is currently in the col=
lections of the first library or archives. Only unpublished works could be =
reproduced under this exemption, but the right would extend to any type of =
work, including photographs, motion pictures and sound recordings. Under th=
is exemption, for example, a repository could make photocopies of manuscrip=
ts by microfilm or electrostatic process, but could not reproduce the work =
in "machine-readable" language for storage in an information system.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Replacement of Damaged Copy.</strong> Subsec=
tion (c) authorizes the reproduction of a published work duplicated in facs=
imile form solely for the purpose of replacement of a copy or phonorecord t=
hat is damaged, deteriorating, lost or stolen, if the library or archives h=
as, after a reasonable effort, determined that an unused replacement cannot=
 be obtained at a fair price. The scope and nature of a reasonable investig=
ation to determine that an unused replacement cannot be obtained will vary =
according to the circumstances of a particular situation. It will always re=
quire recourse to commonly-known trade sources in the United States, and in=
 the normal situation also to the publisher or other copyright owner (if su=
ch owner can be located at the address listed in the copyright registration=
), or an authorized reproducing service.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Articles and Small Excerpts.</strong> Subsec=
tion (d) authorizes the reproduction and distribution of a copy of not more=
 than one article or other contribution to a copyrighted collection or peri=
odical issue, or of a copy or phonorecord of a small part of any other copy=
righted work. The copy or phonorecord may be made by the library where the =
user makes his request or by another library pursuant to an interlibrary lo=
an. It is further required that the copy become the property of the user, t=
hat the library or archives have no notice that the copy would be used for =
any purposes other than private study, scholarship or research, and that th=
e library or archives display prominently at the place where reproduction r=
equests are accepted, and includes in its order form, a warning of copyrigh=
t in accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall pre=
scribe by regulation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Out-of-Print Works.</strong> Subsection (e) =
authorizes the reproduction and distribution of a copy or phonorecord of an=
 entire work under certain circumstances, if it has been established that a=
 copy cannot be obtained at a fair price. The copy may be made by the libra=
ry where the user makes his request or by another library pursuant to an in=
terlibrary loan. The scope and nature of a reasonable investigation to dete=
rmine that an unused copy cannot be obtained will vary according to the cir=
cumstances of a particular situation. It will always require recourse to co=
mmonly-known trade sources in the United States, and in the normal situatio=
n also to the publisher or other copyright owner (if the owner can be locat=
ed at the address listed in the copyright registration), or an authorized r=
eproducing service. It is further required that the copy become the propert=
y of the user, that the library or archives have no notice that the copy wo=
uld be used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or resea=
rch, and that the library or archives display prominently at the place wher=
e reproduction requests are accepted, and include on its order form, a warn=
ing of copyright in accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyr=
ights shall prescribe by regulation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>General Exemptions.</strong> Clause (1) of s=
ubsection (f) specifically exempts a library or archives or its employees f=
rom liability for the unsupervised use of reproducing equipment located on =
its premises, provided that the reproducing equipment displays a notice tha=
t the making of a copy may be subject to the copyright law. Clause (2) of s=
ubsection (f) makes clear that this exemption of the library or archives do=
es not extend to the person using such equipment or requesting such copy if=
 the use exceeds fair use. Insofar as such person is concerned the copy or =
phonorecord made is not considered "lawfully" made for purposes of sections=
 109, 110 or other provisions of the title.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (3) provides that nothing in section 108 is i=
ntended to limit the reproduction and distribution by lending of a limited =
number of copies and excerpts of an audiovisual news program. This exemptio=
n is intended to apply to the daily newscasts of the national television ne=
tworks, which report the major events of the day. It does not apply to docu=
mentary (except documentary programs involving news reporting as that <!-- =
PDFPage:32 -->term is used in section 107), magazine-format or other public=
 affairs broadcasts dealing with subjects of general interest to the viewin=
g public.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The clause was first added to the revision bill in 1=
974 by the adoption of an amendment proposed by Senator Baker. It is intend=
ed to permit libraries and archives, subject to the general conditions of t=
his section, to make off-the-air videotape recordings of daily network news=
 casts for limited distribution to scholars and researchers for use in rese=
arch purposes. As such, it is an adjunct to the American Television and Rad=
io Archive established in Section 113 of the Act [2 U.S.C. 170] which will =
be the principal repository for television broadcast material, including ne=
ws broadcasts, the inclusion of language indicating that such material may =
only be distributed by lending by the library or archive is intended to pre=
clude performance, copying, or sale, whether or not for profit, by the reci=
pient of a copy of a television broadcast taped off-the-air pursuant to thi=
s clause.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (4), in addition to asserting that nothing co=
ntained in section 108 "affects the right of fair use as provided by sectio=
n 107", also provides that the right of reproduction granted by this sectio=
n does not override any contractual arrangements assumed by a library or ar=
chives when it obtained a work for its collections: For example, if there i=
s an express contractual prohibition against reproduction for any purpose, =
this legislation shall not be construed as justifying a violation of the co=
ntract. This clause is intended to encompass the situation where an individ=
ual makes papers, manuscripts or other works available to a library with th=
e understanding that they will not be reproduced.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">It is the intent of this legislation that a subseque=
nt unlawful use by a user of a copy or phonorecord of a work lawfully made =
by a library, shall not make the library liable for such improper use.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Multiple Copies and Systematic Reproduction.=
</strong> Subsection (g) provides that the rights granted by this section e=
xtend only to the "isolated and unrelated reproduction of a single copy or =
phonorecord of the same material on separate occasions." However, this sect=
ion does not authorize the related or concerted reproduction of multiple co=
pies or phonorecords of the same material, whether made on one occasion or =
over a period of time, and whether intended for aggregate use by one indivi=
dual or for separate use by the individual members of a group.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">With respect to material described in subsection (d)=
=E2=80=94articles or other contributions to periodicals or collections, and=
 small parts of other copyrighted works=E2=80=94subsection (g)(2) provides =
that the exemptions of section 108 do not apply if the library or archive e=
ngages in "systematic reproduction or distribution of single or multiple co=
pies or phonorecords." This provision in S. 22 provoked a storm of controve=
rsy, centering around the extent to which the restrictions on "systematic" =
activities would prevent the continuation and development of interlibrary n=
etworks and other arrangements involving the exchange of photocopies. After=
 thorough consideration, the Committee amended section 108(g)(2) to add the=
 following proviso:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em"><i>Provided</i>, that nothing in this clause pre=
vents a library or archives from participating in interlibrary arrangements=
 that do not have, as their purpose or effect, that the library or archives=
 receiving such copies or phonorecords for distribution does so in such agg=
regate quantities as to substitute for a subscription to or purchase of suc=
h work.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In addition, the Committee added a new subsection (i=
) to section 108 [this section], requiring the Register of Copyrights, five=
 years from the effective date of the new Act and at five-year intervals th=
ereafter, to report to Congress upon "the extent to which this section has =
achieved the intended statutory balancing of the rights of creators, and th=
e needs of users," and to make appropriate legislative or other recommendat=
ions. As noted in connection with section 107, the Committee also amended s=
ection 504(c) in a way that would insulate librarians from unwarranted liab=
ility for copyright infringement; this amendment is discussed below.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The key phrases in the Committee's amendment of sect=
ion 108(g)(2) are "aggregate quantities" and "substitute for a subscription=
 to or purchase of" a work. To be implemented effectively in practice, thes=
e provisions will require the development and implementation of more-or-les=
s specific guidelines establishing criteria to govern various situations.</=
p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The National Commission on New Technological Uses of=
 Copyrighted Works (CONTU) offered to provide good offices in helping to de=
velop these guidelines. This offer was accepted and, although the final tex=
t of guidelines has not yet been achieved, the Committee has reason to hope=
 that, within the next month, some agreement can be reached on an initial s=
et of guidelines covering practices under section 108(g)(2).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Works Excluded.</strong> Subsection (h) prov=
ides that the rights of reproduction and distribution under this section do=
 not apply to a musical work, a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work, or a=
 motion picture or other audiovisual work other than "an audiovisual work d=
ealing with news." The latter term is intended as the equivalent in meaning=
 of the phrase "audiovisual news program" in section 108(f)(3). The exclusi=
ons under subsection (h) do not apply to archival reproduction under subsec=
tion (b), to replacement of damaged or lost copies or phonorecords under su=
bsection (c), or to "pictorial or graphic works published as illustrations,=
 diagrams, or similar adjuncts to works of which copies are reproduced or d=
istributed in accordance with subsections (d) and (e)."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Although subsection (h) generally removes musical, g=
raphic, and audiovisual works from the specific exemptions of section 108, =
it is important to recognize that the doctrine of fair use under section 10=
7 remains fully applicable to the photocopying or other reproduction of suc=
h works. In the case of music, for example, it would be fair use for a scho=
lar doing musicological research to have a library supply a copy of a porti=
on of a score or to reproduce portions of a phonorecord of a work. Nothing =
in section 108 impairs the applicability of the fair use doctrine to a wide=
 variety of situations involving photocopying or other reproduction by a li=
brary of copyrighted material in its collections, where the user requests t=
he reproduction for legitimate scholarly or research purposes.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Effect on Further Disposition of Copy or Pho=
norecord.</strong> Section 109(a) restates and confirms the principle that,=
 where the copyright owner has transferred ownership of a particular copy o=
r phonorecord of a work, the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is tran=
sferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental, or any other means. U=
nder this principle, which has been established by the court decisions and =
section 27 of the present law [section 27 of former title 17], the copyrigh=
t owner's exclusive right of public distribution would have no effect upon =
anyone who owns "a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this =
title" and who wishes to transfer it to someone else or to destroy it.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Thus, for example, the outright sale of an authorize=
d copy of a book frees it from any copyright control over its resale price =
or other conditions of its future disposition. A library that has acquired =
ownership of a copy is entitled to lend it under any conditions it chooses =
to impose. This does not mean that conditions on future disposition of copi=
es or phonorecords, imposed by a contract between their buyer and seller, w=
ould be unenforceable between the parties as a breach of contract, but it d=
oes mean that they could not be enforced by an action for infringement of c=
opyright. Under section 202 however, the owner of the physical copy or phon=
orecord cannot reproduce or perform the copyrighted work publicly without t=
he copyright owner's consent.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">To come within the scope of section 109(a), a copy o=
r phonorecord must have been "lawfully made under this title," though not n=
ecessarily with the copyright owner's authorization. For example, any resal=
e of an illegally "pirated" phonorecord would be an infringement, but the d=
isposition of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory licensing pro=
visions of section 115 would not.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Effect on Display of Copy.</strong> Subsecti=
on (b) of section 109 deals with the scope of the copyright owner's exclusi=
ve right to control the public display of a particular "copy" of a work (in=
cluding the original or prototype copy in which the work was first fixed). =
Assuming, for example, that a painter has sold the only copy of an original=
 work of art without restrictions, would it be possible for him to restrain=
 the new owner from displaying it publicly in galleries, shop windows, on a=
 projector, or on television?</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 109(b) adopts the general principle that the=
 lawful owner of a copy of a work should be able to put his copy on public =
display without the consent of the copyright owner. As in cases arising und=
er section 109(a), this does not mean that contractual restrictions on disp=
lay between a buyer and seller would be unenforceable as a matter of contra=
ct law.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The exclusive right of public display granted by sec=
tion 106(5) would not apply where the owner of a copy wishes to show it dir=
ectly to the public, as in a gallery or display case, or indirectly, as thr=
ough an opaque projector. Where the copy itself is intended for projection,=
 as in the case of a photographic slide, negative, or transparency, the pub=
lic projection of a single image would be permitted as long as the viewers =
are "present at the place where the copy is located."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">On the other hand, section 109(b) takes account of t=
he potentialities of the new communications media, notably television, cabl=
e and optical transmission devices, and information storage and retrieval d=
evices, for replacing printed copies with visual images. First of all, the =
public display of an image of a copyrighted work would not be exempted from=
 copyright control if the copy from which the image was derived were outsid=
e the presence of the viewers. In other words, the display of a visual imag=
e of a copyrighted work would be an infringement if the image were transmit=
ted by any method (by closed or open circuit television, for example, or by=
 a computer system) from one place to members of the public located elsewhe=
re.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Moreover, the exemption would extend only to public =
displays that are made "either directly or by the projection of no more tha=
n one image at a time." Thus, even where the copy and the viewers are locat=
ed at the same place, the simultaneous projection of multiple images of the=
 work would not be exempted. For example, where each person in a lecture ha=
ll is supplied with a separate viewing apparatus, the copyright owner's per=
mission would generally be required in order to project an image of a work =
on each individual screen at the same time.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The committee's intention is to preserve the traditi=
onal privilege of the owner of a copy to display it directly, but to place =
reasonable restrictions on the ability to display it indirectly in such a w=
ay that the copyright owner's market for reproduction and distribution of c=
opies would be affected. Unless it constitutes a fair use under section 107=
, or unless one of the special provisions of section 110 or 111 is applicab=
le, projection of more than one image at a time, or transmission of an imag=
e to the public over television or other communication channels, would be a=
n infringement for the same reasons that reproduction in copies would be. T=
he concept of "the place where the copy is located" is generally intended t=
o refer to a situation in which the <!-- PDFPage:35 -->viewers are present =
in the same physical surroundings as the copy, even though they cannot see =
the copy directly.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Effect of Mere Possession of Copy or Phonore=
cord.</strong> Subsection (c) of section 109 qualifies the privileges speci=
fied in subsections (a) and (b) by making clear that they do not apply to s=
omeone who merely possesses a copy or phonorecord without having acquired o=
wnership of it. Acquisition of an object embodying a copyrighted work by re=
ntal, lease, loan, or bailment carries with it no privilege to dispose of t=
he copy under section 109(a) or to display it publicly under section 109(b)=
. To cite a familiar example, a person who has rented a print of a motion p=
icture from the copyright owner would have no right to rent it to someone e=
lse without the owner's permission.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Burden of Proof in Infringement Actions.</st=
rong> During the course of its deliberations on this section, the Committee=
's attention was directed to a recent court decision holding that the plain=
tiff in an infringement action had the burden of establishing that the alle=
gedly infringing copies in the defendant's possession were not lawfully mad=
e or acquired under section 27 of the present law [section 27 of former tit=
le 17]. <i>American International Pictures, Inc. v. Foreman</i>, 400 F.Supp=
. 928 (S.D.Alabama 1975). The Committee believes that the court's decision,=
 if followed, would place a virtually impossible burden on copyright owners=
. The decision is also inconsistent with the established legal principle th=
at the burden of proof should not be placed upon a litigant to establish fa=
cts particularly within the knowledge of his adversary. The defendant in su=
ch actions clearly has the particular knowledge of how possession of the pa=
rticular copy was acquired, and should have the burden of providing this ev=
idence to the court. It is the intent of the Committee, therefore, that in =
an action to determine whether a defendant is entitled to the privilege est=
ablished by section 109(a) and (b), the burden of proving whether a particu=
lar copy was lawfully made or acquired should rest on the defendant.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clauses (1) through (4) of section 110 deal with per=
formances and exhibitions that are now generally exempt under the "for prof=
it" limitation or other provisions of the copyright law, and that are speci=
fically exempted from copyright liability under this legislation. Clauses (=
1) and (2) between them are intended to cover all of the various methods by=
 which performances or displays in the course of systematic instruction tak=
e place.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Face-to-Face Teaching Activities.</strong> C=
lause (1) of section 110 is generally intended to set out the conditions <!=
-- PDFPage:39 -->under which performances or displays, in the course of ins=
tructional activities other than educational broadcasting, are to be exempt=
ed from copyright control. The clause covers all types of copyrighted works=
, and exempts their performance or display "by instructors or pupils in the=
 course of face-to-face teaching activities of a nonprofit educational inst=
itution," where the activities take place "in a classroom or similar place =
devoted to instruction."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">There appears to be no need for a statutory definiti=
on of "face-to-face" teaching activities to clarify the scope of the provis=
ion. "Face-to-face teaching activities" under clause (1) embrace instructio=
nal performances and displays that are not "transmitted." The concept does =
not require that the teacher and students be able to see each other, althou=
gh it does require their simultaneous presence in the same general place. U=
se of the phrase "in the course of face-to-face teaching activities" is int=
ended to exclude broadcasting or other transmissions from an outside locati=
on into classrooms, whether radio or television and whether open or closed =
circuit. However, as long as the instructor and pupils are in the same buil=
ding or general area, the exemption would extend to the use of devices for =
amplifying or reproducing sound and for projecting visual images. The "teac=
hing activities" exempted by the clause encompass systematic instruction of=
 a very wide variety of subjects, but they do not include performances or d=
isplays, whatever their cultural value or intellectual appeal, that are giv=
en for the recreation or entertainment of any part of their audience.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Works Affected</i>.=E2=80=94Since there is no lim=
itation on the types of works covered by the exemption, teachers or student=
s would be free to perform or display anything in class as long as the othe=
r conditions of the clause are met. They could read aloud from copyrighted =
text material, act out a drama, play or sing a musical work, perform a moti=
on picture or filmstrip, or display text or pictorial material to the class=
 by means of a projector. However, nothing in this provision is intended to=
 sanction the unauthorized reproduction of copies or phonorecords for the p=
urpose of classroom performance or display, and the clause contains a speci=
al exception dealing with performances from unlawfully made copies of motio=
n pictures and other audiovisual works, to be discussed below.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Instructors or Pupils</i>.=E2=80=94To come within=
 clause (1), the performance or display must be "by instructors or pupils,"=
 thus ruling out performances by actors, singers, or instrumentalists broug=
ht in from outside the school to put on a program. However, the term "instr=
uctors" would be broad enough to include guest lecturers if their instructi=
onal activities remain confined to classroom situations. In general, the te=
rm "pupils" refers to the enrolled members of a class.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Nonprofit Educational Institution</i>.=E2=80=94Cl=
ause (1) makes clear that it applies only to the teaching activities "of a =
nonprofit educational institution," thus excluding from the exemption perfo=
rmances or displays in profit-making institutions such as dance studios and=
 language schools.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Classroom or Similar Place</i>.=E2=80=94The teach=
ing activities exempted by the clause must take place "in a classroom or si=
milar place devoted to instruction." For example, performances in an audito=
rium or stadium during a school assembly, graduation ceremony, class play, =
or sporting event, where the audience is not confined to the members of a p=
articular class, would fall outside the scope of clause (1), although in so=
me cases they might be exempted by clause (4) of section 110. The "similar =
place" referred to in clause (1) is a place which is "devoted to instructio=
n" in the same way a classroom is; common examples would include a studio, =
a workshop, a gymnasium, a training field, a library, the stage of an audit=
orium, or the auditorium itself, if it is actually used as a classroom for =
systematic instructional activities.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works</i>.=
=E2=80=94The final provision of clause (1) deals with the special problem o=
f performances from unlawfully-made copies of motion pictures and other aud=
iovisual works. The exemption is lost where the copy being used for a class=
room performance was "not lawfully made under this title" and the person re=
sponsible for the performance knew or had reason to suspect as much. This s=
pecial exception to the exemption would not apply to performances from lawf=
ully-made copies, even if the copies were acquired from someone who had sto=
len or converted them, or if the performances were in violation of an agree=
ment. However, though the performance would be exempt under section 110(1) =
in such cases, the copyright owner might have a cause of action against the=
 unauthorized distributor under section 106(3), or against the person respo=
nsible for the performance, for breach of contract.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Projection Devices</i>.=E2=80=94As long as there =
is no transmission beyond the place where the copy is located, both section=
 109(b) and section 110(1) would permit the classroom display of a work by =
means of any sort of projection device or process.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Instructional Broadcasting. <i>Works Affecte=
d</i></strong>.=E2=80=94The exemption for instructional broadcasting provid=
ed by section 110(2) would apply only to "performance of a nondramatic lite=
rary or musical work or display of a work." Thus, the copyright owner's per=
mission would be required for the performance on educational television or =
radio of a dramatic work, of a dramatico-musical work such as an opera or m=
usical comedy, or of a motion picture. Since, as already explained, audiovi=
sual works such as filmstrips are equated with motion pictures, their seque=
ntial showing would be regarded as a performance rather than a display and =
would not be exempt under section 110(2). The clause is not intended to lim=
it in any way the copyright owner's exclusive right to make dramatizations,=
 adaptations, or other derivative works under section 106(2). Thus, for exa=
mple, a performer could read a nondramatic literary work aloud under sectio=
n 110(2), but the copyright owner's permission would be required for him to=
 act it out in dramatic form.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Systematic Instructional Activities</i>.=E2=80=94=
Under section 110(2) a transmission must meet three specified conditions in=
 order to be exempted from copyright liability. The first of these, as prov=
ided by subclause (A), is that the performance or display must be "a regula=
r part of the systematic instructional activities of a governmental body or=
 a nonprofit educational institution." The concept of "systematic instructi=
onal activities" is intended as the general equivalent of "curriculums," bu=
t it could be broader in a case such as that of an institution using system=
atic teaching methods not related to specific course work. A transmission w=
ould be a regular part of these activities if it is in accordance with the =
pattern of teaching established by the governmental body or institution. Th=
e use of commercial facilities, such as those of a cable service, to transm=
it the performance or display, would not affect the exemption as long as th=
e actual performance or display was for nonprofit purposes.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Content of Transmission</i>.=E2=80=94Subclause (B=
) requires that the performance or display be directly related and of mater=
ial assistance to the teaching content of the transmission.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Intended Recipients</i>.=E2=80=94Subclause (C) re=
quires that the transmission is made primarily for:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em"><i>(i)</i> Reception in classrooms or similar pl=
aces normally devoted to instruction, or</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em"><i>(ii)</i> Reception by persons to whom the tra=
nsmission is directed because their disabilities or other special circumsta=
nces prevent their attendance in classrooms or similar places normally devo=
ted to instruction, or</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em"><i>(iii)</i> Reception by officers or employees =
of governmental bodies as a part of their official duties or employment.</p=
>
<p class=3D"note-body">In all three cases, the instructional transmission n=
eed only be made "primarily" rather than "solely" to the specified recipien=
ts to be exempt. Thus, the transmission could still be exempt even though i=
t is capable of reception by the public at large. Conversely, it would <!--=
 PDFPage:40 -->not be regarded as made "primarily" for one of the required =
groups of recipients if the principal purpose behind the transmission is re=
ception by the public at large, even if it is cast in the form of instructi=
on and is also received in classrooms. Factors to consider in determining t=
he "primary" purpose of a program would include its subject matter, content=
, and the time of its transmission.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Paragraph (i) of subclause (C) generally covers what=
 are known as "in-school" broadcasts, whether open- or closed-circuit. The =
reference to "classrooms or similar places" here is intended to have the sa=
me meaning as that of the phrase as used in section 110(1). The exemption i=
n paragraph (ii) is intended to exempt transmissions providing systematic i=
nstruction to individuals who cannot be reached in classrooms because of "t=
heir disabilities or other special circumstances." Accordingly, the exempti=
on is confined to instructional broadcasting that is an adjunct to the actu=
al classwork of nonprofit schools or is primarily for people who cannot be =
brought together in classrooms such as preschool children, displaced worker=
s, illiterates, and shut-ins.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">There has been some question as to whether or not th=
e language in this section of the bill is intended to include instructional=
 television college credit courses. These telecourses are aimed at undergra=
duate and graduate students in earnest pursuit of higher educational degree=
s who are unable to attend daytime classes because of daytime employment, d=
istance from campus, or some other intervening reason. So long as these bro=
adcasts are aimed at regularly enrolled students and conducted by recognize=
d higher educational institutions, the committee believes that they are cle=
arly within the language of section 110(2)(C)(ii). Like night school and co=
rrespondence courses before them, these telecourses are fast becoming a val=
uable adjunct of the normal college curriculum.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The third exemption in subclause (C) is intended to =
permit the use of copyrighted material, in accordance with the other condit=
ions of section 110(2), in the course of instructional transmissions for Go=
vernment personnel who are receiving training "as a part of their official =
duties or employment."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Religious Services.</strong> The exemption i=
n clause (3) of section 110 covers performances of a nondramatic literary o=
r musical work, and also performances "of dramatico-musical works of a reli=
gious nature"; in addition, it extends to displays of works of all kinds. T=
he exemption applies where the performance or display is "in the course of =
services at a place of worship or other religious assembly." The scope of t=
he clause does not cover the sequential showing of motion pictures and othe=
r audiovisual works.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The exemption, which to some extent has its counterp=
art in sections 1 and 104 of the present law [sections 1 and 104 of former =
title 17], applies to dramatico-musical works "of a religious nature." The =
purpose here is to exempt certain performances of sacred music that might b=
e regarded as "dramatic" in nature, such as oratorios, cantatas, musical se=
ttings of the mass, choral services, and the like. The exemption is not int=
ended to cover performances of secular operas, musical plays, motion pictur=
es, and the like, even if they have an underlying religious or philosophica=
l theme and take place "in the course of [religious] services."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">To be exempted under section 110(3) a performance or=
 display must be "in the course of services," thus excluding activities at =
a place of worship that are for social, educational, fund raising, or enter=
tainment purposes. Some performances of these kinds could be covered by the=
 exemption in section 110(4), discussed next. Since the performance or disp=
lay must also occur "at a place of worship or other religious assembly," th=
e exemption would not extend to religious broadcasts or other transmissions=
 to the public at large, even where the transmissions were sent from the pl=
ace of worship. On the other hand, as long as services are being conducted =
before a religious gathering, the exemption would apply if they were conduc=
ted in places such as auditoriums, outdoor theaters, and the like.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Certain Other Nonprofit Performances.</stron=
g> In addition to the educational and religious exemptions provided by clau=
ses (1) through (3) of section 110, clause (4) contains a general exception=
 to the exclusive right of public performance that would cover some, though=
 not all, of the same ground as the present "for profit" limitation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Scope of Exemption</i>.=E2=80=94The exemption in =
clause (4) applies to the same general activities and subject matter as tho=
se covered by the "for profit" limitation today: public performances of non=
dramatic literary and musical works. However, the exemption would be limite=
d to public performances given directly in the presence of an audience whet=
her by means of living performers, the playing of phonorecords, or the oper=
ation of a receiving apparatus, and would not include a "transmission to th=
e public." Unlike the clauses (1) through (3) and (5) of section 110, but l=
ike clauses (6) through (8), clause (4) applies only to performing rights i=
n certain works, and does not affect the exclusive right to display a work =
in public.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>No Profit Motive</i>.=E2=80=94In addition to the =
other conditions specified by the clause, the performance must be "without =
any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage." This provision exp=
ressly adopts the principle established by the court decisions construing t=
he "for profit" limitation: that public performances given or sponsored in =
connection with any commercial or profit-making enterprises are subject to =
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner even though the public is not c=
harged for seeing or hearing the performance.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>No Payment for Performance</i>.=E2=80=94An import=
ant condition for this exemption is that the performance be given "without =
payment of any fee or other compensation for the performance to any of its =
performers, promoters, or organizers." The basic purpose of this requiremen=
t is to prevent the free use of copyrighted material under the guise of cha=
rity where fees or percentages are paid to performers, promoters, producers=
, and the like. However, the exemption would not be lost if the performers,=
 directors, or producers of the performance, instead of being paid directly=
 "for the performance," are paid a salary for duties encompassing the perfo=
rmance. Examples are performances by a school orchestra conducted by a musi=
c teacher who receives an annual salary, or by a service band whose members=
 and conductors perform as part of their assigned duties and who receive mi=
litary pay. The committee believes that performances of this type should be=
 exempt, assuming the other conditions in clause (4) are met, and has not a=
dopted the suggestion that the word "salary" be added to the phrase referri=
ng to the "payment of any fee or other compensation."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Admission Charge</i>.=E2=80=94Assuming that the p=
erformance involves no profit motive and no one responsible for it gets pai=
d a fee, it must still meet one of two alternative conditions to be exempt.=
 As specified in subclauses (A) and (B) of section 110(4), these conditions=
 are: (1) that no direct or indirect admission charge is made, or (2) that =
the net proceeds are "used exclusively for educational, religious, or chari=
table purposes and not for private financial gain."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the second of these conditions, a performance =
meeting the other conditions of clause (4) would be exempt even if an admis=
sion fee is charged, provided any amounts left "after deducting the reasona=
ble costs of producing the performance" are used solely for bona fide educa=
tional, religious, or charitable purposes. In cases arising under this seco=
nd condition and as provided in subclause (B), where there is an admission =
charge, the copyright owner is given an opportunity to decide whether and u=
nder what conditions the copyrighted work should be performed; otherwise, o=
wners could be compelled to make involuntary donations to the fund-raising =
activities of causes to which they are opposed. The subclause would thus pe=
rmit copyright owners to prevent public performances of their works under s=
ection 110(4)(B) by serving notice of objection, with the reasons therefor,=
 at least seven days in advance.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Mere Reception in Public.</strong> Unlike th=
e first four clauses of section 110, clause (5) is not to any extent a <!--=
 PDFPage:41 -->counterpart of the "for profit" limitation of the present st=
atute. It applies to performances and displays of all types of works, and i=
ts purpose is to exempt from copyright liability anyone who merely turns on=
, in a public place, an ordinary radio or television receiving apparatus of=
 a kind commonly sold to members of the public for private use.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The basic rationale of this clause is that the secon=
dary use of the transmission by turning on an ordinary receiver in public i=
s so remote and minimal that no further liability should be imposed. In the=
 vast majority of these cases no royalties are collected today, and the exe=
mption should be made explicit in the statute. This clause has nothing to d=
o with cable television systems and the exemptions would be denied in any c=
ase where the audience is charged directly to see or hear the transmission.=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">With respect to section 110(5), the conference subst=
itute conforms to the language in the Senate bill. It is the intent of the =
conferees that a small commercial establishment of the type involved in <i>=
Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken</i>, 422 U.S. 151 (1975), [95 S.Ct. =
2040, 45 L.Ed.2d 84], which merely augmented a home-type receiver and which=
 was not of sufficient size to justify, as a practical matter, a subscripti=
on to a commercial background music service, would be exempt. However, wher=
e the public communication was by means of something other than a home-type=
 receiving apparatus, or where the establishment actually makes a further t=
ransmission to the public, the exemption would not apply.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">On June 17, 1975, the Supreme Court handed down a de=
cision in <i>Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken</i>, 95 S.Ct. 2040 [422=
 U.S. 151, 45 L.Ed.2d 84], that raised fundamental questions about the prop=
er interpretation of section 110(5). The defendant, owner and operator of a=
 fast-service food shop in downtown Pittsburgh, had "a radio with outlets t=
o four speakers in the ceiling," which he apparently turned on and left on =
throughout the business day. Lacking any performing license, he was sued fo=
r copyright infringement by two ASCAP members. He lost in the District Cour=
t, won a reversal in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and finally prevai=
led, by a margin of 7=E2=80=932, in the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The <i>Aiken</i> decision is based squarely on the t=
wo Supreme Court decisions dealing with cable television. In <i>Fortnightly=
 Corp. v. United Artists</i>, 392 U.S. 390 [88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176,=
 rehearing denied 89 S.Ct. 65, 393 U.S. 902, 21 L.Ed.2d 190], and again in =
<i>Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS</i>, 415 U.S. 394 [94 S.Ct. 1129, 39 L.Ed.2d 4=
15], the Supreme Court has held that a CATV operator was not "performing" w=
ithin the meaning of the 1909 statute, when it picked up broadcast signals =
off the air and retransmitted them to subscribers by cable. The <i>Aiken</i=
> decision extends this interpretation of the scope of the 1909 statute's r=
ight of "public performance for profit" to a situation outside the CATV con=
text and, without expressly overruling the decision in <i>Buck v. Jewell-La=
Salle Realty Co</i>., 283 U.S. 191 (1931) [51 S.Ct. 410, 75 L.Ed. 971], eff=
ectively deprives it of much meaning under the present law. For more than f=
orty years the <i>Jewell-LaSalle</i> rule was thought to require a business=
 establishment to obtain copyright licenses before it could legally pick up=
 any broadcasts off the air and retransmit them to its guests and patrons. =
As reinterpreted by the <i>Aiken</i> decision, the rule of <i>Jewell-LaSall=
e</i> applies only if the broadcast being retransmitted was itself unlicens=
ed.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The majority of the Supreme Court in the <i>Aiken</i=
> case based its decision on a narrow construction of the word "perform" in=
 the 1909 statute. This basis for the decision is completely overturned by =
the present bill and its broad definition of "perform" in section 101. The =
Committee has adopted the language of section 110(5) with an amendment expr=
essly denying the exemption in situations where "the performance or display=
 is further transmitted beyond the place where the receiving apparatus is l=
ocated"; in doing so, it accepts the traditional, pre-<i>Aiken</i>, interpr=
etation of the <i>Jewell-LaSalle</i> decision, under which public communica=
tion by means other than a home receiving set, or further transmission of a=
 broadcast to the public, is considered an infringing act.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the particular fact situation in the <i>Aiken<=
/i> case, assuming a small commercial establishment and the use of a home r=
eceiver with four ordinary loudspeakers grouped within a relatively narrow =
circumference from the set, it is intended that the performances would be e=
xempt under clause (5). However, the Committee considers this fact situatio=
n to represent the outer limit of the exemption, and believes that the line=
 should be drawn at that point. Thus, the clause would exempt small commerc=
ial establishments whose proprietors merely bring onto their premises stand=
ard radio or television equipment and turn it on for their customers' enjoy=
ment, but it would impose liability where the proprietor has a commercial "=
sound system" installed or converts a standard home receiving apparatus (by=
 augmenting it with sophisticated or extensive amplification equipment) int=
o the equivalent of a commercial sound system. Factors to consider in parti=
cular cases would include the size, physical arrangement, and noise level o=
f the areas within the establishment where the transmissions are made audib=
le or visible, and the extent to which the receiving apparatus is altered o=
r augmented for the purpose of improving the aural or visual quality of the=
 performance for individual members of the public using those areas.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Agricultural Fairs.</strong> The Committee a=
lso amended clause (6) of section 110 of S. 22 as adopted by the Senate. As=
 amended, the provision would exempt "performance of a nondramatic musical =
work by a governmental body or a nonprofit agricultural or horticultural or=
ganization, in the course of an annual agricultural or horticultural fair o=
r exhibition conducted by such body or organization." The exemption extends=
 only to the governmental body or nonprofit organization sponsoring the fai=
r; the amendment makes clear that, while such a body or organization cannot=
 itself be held vicariously liable for infringements by concessionaires at =
the fair, the concessionaires themselves enjoy no exemption under the claus=
e.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Retail Sale of Phonorecords.</strong> Clause=
 (7) provides that the performance of a nondramatic musical work or of a so=
und recording by a vending establishment open to the public at large withou=
t any direct or indirect admission charge, where the sole purpose of the pe=
rformance is to promote the retail sale of copies or phonorecords of the wo=
rk, is not an infringement of copyright. This exemption applies only if the=
 performance is not transmitted beyond the place where the establishment is=
 located and is within the immediate area where the sale is occurring.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Transmission to Handicapped Audiences.</stro=
ng> The new clause (8) of subsection 110, which had been added to S. 22 by =
the Senate Judiciary Committee when it reported the bill on November 20, 19=
75, and had been adopted by the Senate on February 19, 1976, was substantia=
lly amended by the Committee. Under the amendment, the exemption would appl=
y only to performances of "nondramatic literary works" by means of "a trans=
mission specifically designed for and primarily directed to" one or the oth=
er of two defined classes of handicapped persons: (1) "blind or other handi=
capped persons who are unable to read normal printed material as a result o=
f their handicap" or (2) "deaf or other handicapped persons who are unable =
to hear the aural signals accompanying a transmission." Moreover, the exemp=
tion would be applicable only if the performance is "without any purpose of=
 direct or indirect commercial advantage," and if the transmission takes pl=
ace through government facilities or through the facilities of a noncommerc=
ial educational broadcast station, a radio subcarrier authorization (SCA), =
or a cable system.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Introduction and General Summary.</strong> T=
he complex and economically important problem of "secondary transmissions" =
is considered in section 111. For the most part, the section is directed at=
 the operation of cable television systems and the terms and conditions of =
their liability for the retransmission of copyrighted works. However, other=
 forms of secondary transmissions are also considered, including apartment =
house and hotel systems, wired instructional systems, common carriers, nonp=
rofit "boosters" and translators, and secondary transmissions of primary tr=
ansmissions to controlled groups.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Cable television systems are commercial subscription=
 services that pick up broadcasts of programs originated by others and retr=
ansmit them to paying subscribers. A typical system consists of a central a=
ntenna which receives and amplifies television signals and a network of cab=
les through which the signals are transmitted to the receiving sets of indi=
vidual subscribers. In addition to an installation charge, the subscribers =
pay a monthly charge for the basic service averaging about six dollars. A l=
arge number of these systems provide automated programing. A growing number=
 of CATV systems also originate programs, such as movies and sports, and ch=
arge additional fees for this service (pay-cable).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The number of cable systems has grown very rapidly s=
ince their introduction in 1950, and now total about 3,450 operating system=
s, servicing 7,700 communities. Systems currently in operation reach about =
10.8 million homes. It is reported that the 1975 total subscriber revenues =
of the cable industry were approximately $770 million.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Pursuant to two decisions of the Supreme Court (<i>F=
ortnightly Corp. v. United Artist Television, Inc</i>., 392 U.S. 390 (1968)=
 [88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176, rehearing denied 89 S.Ct. 65, 393 U.S. 90=
2, 21 L.Ed.2d 190], and <i>Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS, Inc</i>., 415 U.S. 39=
4 (1974)) [94 S.Ct. 1129, 39 L.Ed.2d 415], under the 1909 copyright law, th=
e cable television industry has not been paying copyright royalties for its=
 retransmission of over-the-air broadcast signals. Both decisions urged the=
 Congress, however, to consider and determine the scope and extent of such =
liability in the pending revision bill.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The difficult problem of determining the copyright l=
iability of cable television systems has been before the Congress since 196=
5. In 1967, this Committee sought to address and resolve the issues in H.R.=
 2512, an early version of the general revision bill (see H.R. Rep. No. 83,=
 90th Cong., 1st Sess.). However, largely because of the cable-copyright im=
passe, the bill died in the Senate.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The history of the attempts to find a solution to th=
e problem since 1967 has been explored thoroughly in the voluminous hearing=
s and testimony on the general revision bill, and has also been succinctly =
summarized by the Register of Copyrights in her Second Supplementary Report=
, Chapter V.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee now has before it the Senate bill whic=
h contains a series of detailed and complex provisions which attempt to res=
olve the question of the copyright liability of cable television systems. A=
fter extensive consideration of the Senate bill, the arguments made during =
and after the hearings, and of the issues involved, this Committee has also=
 concluded that there is no simple answer to the cable-copyright controvers=
y. In particular, any statutory scheme that imposes copyright liability on =
cable television systems must take account of the intricate and complicated=
 rules and regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission to =
govern the cable television industry. While the Committee has carefully avo=
ided including in the bill any provisions which would interfere with the FC=
C's rules or which might be characterized as affecting "communications poli=
cy", the Committee has been cognizant of the interplay between the copyrigh=
t and the communications elements of the legislation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">We would, therefore, caution the Federal Communicati=
ons Commission, and others who make determinations concerning communication=
s policy, not to rely upon any action of this Committee as a basis for any =
significant changes in the delicate balance of regulation in areas where th=
e Congress has not resolved the <!-- PDFPage:49 -->issue. Specifically, we =
would urge the Federal Communications Commission to understand that it was =
not the intent of this bill to touch on issues such as pay cable regulation=
 or increased use of imported distant signals. These matters are ones of co=
mmunications policy and should be left to the appropriate committees in the=
 Congress for resolution.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In general, the Committee believes that cable system=
s are commercial enterprises whose basic retransmission operations are base=
d on the carriage of copyrighted program material and that copyright royalt=
ies should be paid by cable operators to the creators of such programs. The=
 Committee recognizes, however, that it would be impractical and unduly bur=
densome to require every cable system to negotiate with every copyright own=
er whose work was retransmitted by a cable system. Accordingly, the Committ=
ee has determined to maintain the basic principle of the Senate bill to est=
ablish a compulsory copyright license for the retransmission of those over-=
the-air broadcast signals that a cable system is authorized to carry pursua=
nt to the rules and regulations of the FCC.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The compulsory license is conditioned, however, on c=
ertain requirements and limitations. These include compliance with reportin=
g requirements, payment of the royalty fees established in the bill, a ban =
on the substitution or deletion of commercial advertising, and geographic l=
imits on the compulsory license for copyrighted programs broadcast by Canad=
ian or Mexican stations. Failure to comply with these requirements and limi=
tations subjects a cable system to a suit for copyright infringement and th=
e remedies provided under the bill for such actions.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In setting a royalty fee schedule for the compulsory=
 license, the Committee determined that the initial schedule should be esta=
blished in the bill. It recognized, however, that adjustments to the schedu=
le would be required from time to time. Accordingly, the Copyright Royalty =
Commission, established in chapter 8 [=C2=A7801 et seq. of this title], is =
empowered to make the adjustments in the initial rates, at specified times,=
 based on standards and conditions set forth in the bill.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In setting an initial fee schedule, the Senate bill =
based the royalty fee on a sliding scale related to the gross receipts of a=
 cable system for providing the basic retransmission service and rejected a=
 statutory scheme that would distinguish between "local" and "distant" sign=
als. The Committee determined, however, that there was no evidence that the=
 retransmission of "local" broadcast signals by a cable operator threatens =
the existing market for copyright program owners. Similarly, the retransmis=
sion of network programing, including network programing which is broadcast=
 in "distant" markets, does not injure the copyright owner. The copyright o=
wner contracts with the network on the basis of his programing reaching all=
 markets served by the network and is compensated accordingly.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">By contrast, their retransmission of distant non-net=
work programing by cable systems causes damage to the copyright owner by di=
stributing the program in an area beyond which it has been licensed. Such r=
etransmission adversely affects the ability of the copyright owner to explo=
it the work in the distant market. It is also of direct benefit to the cabl=
e system by enhancing its ability to attract subscribers and increase reven=
ues. For these reasons, the Committee has concluded that the copyright liab=
ility of cable television systems under the compulsory license should be li=
mited to the retransmission of distant non-network programing.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In implementing this conclusion, the Committee gener=
ally followed a proposal submitted by the cable and motion picture industri=
es, the two industries most directly affected by the establishment of copyr=
ight royalties for cable television systems. Under the proposal, the royalt=
y fee is determined by a two step computation. First, a value called a "dis=
tant signal equivalent" is assigned to all "distant" signals. Distant signa=
ls are defined as signals retransmitted by a cable system, in whole or in p=
art, outside the local service area of the primary transmitter. Different v=
alues are assigned to independent, network, and educational stations becaus=
e of the different amounts of viewing of non-network programing carried by =
such stations. For example, the viewing of non-network programs on network =
stations is considered to approximate 25 percent. These values are then com=
bined and a scale of percentages is applied to the cumulative total.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee also considered various proposals to e=
xempt certain categories of cable systems from royalty payments altogether.=
 The Committee determined that the approach of the Senate bill to require s=
ome payment by every cable system is sound, but established separate fee sc=
hedules for cable systems whose gross receipts for the basic retransmission=
 service do not exceed either $80,000 or $160,000 semiannually. It is the C=
ommittee's view that the fee schedules adopted for these systems are now ap=
propriate, based on their relative size and the services performed.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">All the royalty payments required under the bill are=
 paid on a semiannual basis to the Register of Copyrights. Each year they a=
re distributed by the Copyright Royalty Commission to those copyright owner=
s who may validly claim that their works were the subject of distant non-ne=
twork retransmissions by cable systems.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Based on current estimates supplied to the Committee=
, the total royalty fees paid under the initial schedule established in the=
 bill should approximate $8.7 million. Compared with the present number of =
cable television subscribers, calculated at 10.8 million, copyright payment=
s under the bill would therefore approximate 81 cents per subscriber per ye=
ar. The Committee believes that such payments are modest and will not retar=
d the orderly development of the cable television industry or the service i=
t provides to its subscribers.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Analysis of Provisions.</strong> Throughout =
section 111, the operative terms are "primary transmission" and "secondary =
transmission." These terms are defined in subsection (f) entirely in relati=
on to each other. In any particular case, the "primary" transmitter is the =
one whose signals are being picked up and further transmitted by a "seconda=
ry" transmitter which in turn, is someone engaged in "the further transmitt=
ing of a primary transmission simultaneously with the primary transmission.=
" With one exception provided in subsection (f) and limited by subsection (=
e), the section does not cover or permit a cable system, or indeed any pers=
on, to tape or otherwise record a program off-the-air and later to transmit=
 the program from the tape or record to the public. The one exception invol=
ves cable systems located outside the continental United States, but not in=
cluding cable systems in Puerto Rico, or, with limited exceptions, Hawaii. =
These systems are permitted to record and retransmit programs under the com=
pulsory license, subject to the restrictive conditions of subsection (e), b=
ecause off-the-air signals are generally not available in the offshore area=
s.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>General Exemptions.</strong> Certain seconda=
ry transmissions are given a general exemption under clause (1) of section =
111(a). The first of these applies to secondary transmissions consisting "e=
ntirely of the relaying, by the management of a hotel, apartment house, or =
similar establishment" of a transmission to the private lodgings of guests =
or residents and provided "no direct charge is made to see or hear the seco=
ndary transmission."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The exemption would not apply if the secondary trans=
mission consists of anything other than the mere relay of ordinary broadcas=
ts. The cutting out of advertising, the running in of new commercials, or a=
ny other change in the signal relayed would subject the secondary transmitt=

ooms used as living quarters or for private parties, and does not include d=
ining rooms, meeting halls, theatres, ballrooms, or similar places that are=
 outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances. No sp=
ecial exception is needed to make clear that the mere placing of an ordinar=
y radio or television set in a private hotel room does not constitute an in=
fringement.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:50 --><p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Secondary Transmissions o=
f Instructional Broadcasts.</strong> Clause (2) of section 111(a) is intend=
ed to make clear that an instructional transmission within the scope of sec=
tion 110(2) is exempt whether it is a "primary transmission" or a "secondar=
y transmission."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Carriers.</strong> The general exemption und=
er section 111 extends to secondary transmitters that act solely as passive=
 carriers. Under clause (3), a carrier is exempt if it "has no direct or in=
direct control over the content or selection of the primary transmission or=
 over the particular recipients of the secondary transmission." For this pu=
rpose its activities must "consist solely of providing wires, cables, or ot=
her communications channels for the use of others."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (4) would exempt the activities of secondary =
transmitters that operate on a completely nonprofit basis. The operations o=
f nonprofit "translators" or "boosters," which do nothing more than amplify=
 broadcast signals and retransmit them to everyone in an area for free rece=
ption, would be exempt if there is no "purpose of direct or indirect commer=
cial advantage," and if there is no charge to the recipients "other than as=
sessments necessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintainin=
g and operating the secondary transmission service." This exemption does no=
t apply to a cable television system.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Secondary Transmissions of Primary Transmiss=
ions to Controlled Group.</strong> Notwithstanding the provisions of subsec=
tions (a) and (c), the secondary transmission to the public of a primary tr=
ansmission embodying a performance or display is actionable as an act of in=
fringement if the primary transmission is not made for reception by the pub=
lic at large but is controlled and limited to reception by particular membe=
rs of the public. Examples of transmissions not intended for the general pu=
blic are background music services such as MUZAK, closed circuit broadcasts=
 to theatres, pay television (STV) or pay-cable.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Senate bill contains a provision, however, stati=
ng that the secondary transmission does not constitute an act of infringeme=
nt if the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is =
required under the rules and regulations of the FCC. The exclusive purpose =
of this provision is to exempt a cable system from copyright liability if t=
he FCC should require cable systems to carry to their subscribers a "scramb=
led" pay signal of a subscription television station.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee is concerned, however, that the Senate=
 bill is not clearly limited to the situation where a cable system is requi=
red by the FCC to carry a "scrambled" pay television signal. The Committee =
believes that the provision should not include any authority or permission =
to "unscramble" the signal. Further, the Senate bill does not make clear th=
at the exception would not apply if the primary transmission is made by a c=
able system or cable system network transmitting its own originated program=
, <i>e.g</i>., pay-cable. For these reasons, the subsection was amended to =
provide that the exception would only apply if (1) the primary transmission=
 to a controlled group is made by a broadcast station licensed by the FCC; =
(2) the carriage of the signal is required by FCC rules and regulations; an=
d (3) the signal of the primary transmitter is not altered or changed in an=
y way by the secondary transmitter.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Compulsory License.</strong> Section 111(c) =
establishes the compulsory license for cable systems generally. It provides=
 that, subject to the provisions of clauses (2), (3) and (4), the secondary=
 transmission to the public by a cable system of a primary transmission mad=
e by a broadcast station licensed by the FCC or by an appropriate governmen=
tal authority of Canada or Mexico is subject to compulsory licensing upon c=
ompliance with the provisions of subsection (d) where the carriage of the s=
ignals comprising the secondary transmission is permissible under the rules=
 and regulations of the FCC. The compulsory license applies, therefore, to =
the carriage of over-the-air broadcast signals and is inapplicable to the s=
econdary transmission of any nonbroadcast primary transmission such as a pr=
ogram originated by a cable system or a cable network. The latter would be =
subject to full copyright liability under other sections of the legislation=
.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Limitations on the Compulsory License.</stro=
ng> Sections 111(c)(2), (3) and (4) establish limitations on the scope of t=
he compulsory license, and provide that failure to comply with these limita=
tions subjects a cable system to a suit for infringement and all the remedi=
es provided in the legislation for such actions.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 111(c)(2) provides that the "willful or repe=
ated" carriage of signals not permissible under the rules and regulations o=
f the FCC subjects a cable system to full copyright liability. The words "w=
illful or repeated" are used to prevent a cable system from being subjected=
 to severe penalties for innocent or casual acts ("Repeated" does not mean =
merely "more than once," of course; rather, it denotes a degree of aggravat=
ed negligence which borders on willfulness. Such a condition would not exis=
t in the case of an innocent mistake as to what signals or programs may pro=
perly be carried under the FCC's complicated rules). Section 111(c)(2) also=
 provides that a cable system is subject to full copyright liability where =
the cable system has not recorded the notice, deposited the statement of ac=
count, or paid the royalty fee required by subsection (d). The Committee do=
es not intend, however, that a good faith error by the cable system in comp=
uting the amount due would subject it to full liability as an infringer. Th=
e Committee expects that in most instances of this type the parties would b=
e able to work out the problem without resort to the courts.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Commercial Substitution.</strong> Section 11=
1(c)(3) provides that a cable system is fully subject to the remedies provi=
ded in this legislation for copyright infringement if the cable system will=
fully alters, through changes, deletions, or additions, the content of a pa=
rticular program or any commercial advertising or station announcements tra=
nsmitted by the primary transmitter during, or immediately before or after,=
 the transmission of the program. In the Committee's view, any willful dele=
tion, substitution, or insertion of commercial advertisements of any nature=
 by a cable system or changes in the program content of the primary transmi=
ssion, significantly alters the basic nature of the cable retransmission se=
rvice, and makes its function similar to that of a broadcaster. Further, th=
e placement of substitute advertising in a program by a cable system on a "=
local" signal harms the advertiser and, in turn, the copyright owner, whose=
 compensation for the work is directly related to the size of the audience =
that the advertiser's message is calculated to reach. On a "distant" signal=
, the placement of substitute advertising harms the local broadcaster in th=
e distant market because the cable system is then competing for local adver=
tising dollars without having comparable program costs. The Committee has t=
herefore attempted broadly to proscribe the availability of the compulsory =
license if a cable system substitutes commercial messages. Included in the =
prohibition are commercial messages and station announcements not only duri=
ng, but also immediately before or after the program, so as to insure a con=
tinuous ban on commercial substitution from one program to another. In one =
situation, however, the Committee has permitted such substitution when the =
commercials are inserted by those engaged in television commercial advertis=
ing market research. This exception is limited to those situations where th=
e research company has obtained the consent of the advertiser who purchased=
 the original commercial advertisement, the television station whose signal=
 is retransmitted, and the cable system, and provided further that no incom=
e is derived from the sale of such commercial time.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Canadian and Mexican Signals.</strong> Secti=
on 111(c)(4) provides limitations on the compulsory license with respect to=
 foreign signals carried by cable systems from Canada or Mexico. Under the =
Senate bill, the carriage of any foreign signals by a cable system would ha=
ve been subject to full copyright liability, because the compulsory license=
 was limited to the retransmission of broadcast stations licensed by the FC=
C. The Commit<!-- PDFPage:51 -->tee recognized, however, that cable systems=
 primarily along the northern and southern border have received authorizati=
on from the FCC to carry broadcast signals of certain Canadian and Mexican =
stations.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In the Committee's view, the authorization by the FC=
C to a cable system to carry a foreign signal does not resolve the copyrigh=
t question of the royalty payment that should be made for copyrighted progr=
ams originating in the foreign country. The latter raises important interna=
tional questions of the protection to be accorded foreign copyrighted works=
 in the United States. While the Committee has established a general compul=
sory licensing scheme for the retransmission of copyrighted works of U.S. n=
ationals, a broad compulsory license scheme for all foreign works does not =
appear warranted or justified. Thus, for example, if in the future the sign=
al of a British, French, or Japanese station were retransmitted in the Unit=
ed States by a cable system, full copyright liability would apply.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">With respect to Canadian and Mexican signals, the Co=
mmittee found that a special situation exists regarding the carriage of the=
se signals by U.S. cable systems on the northern and southern borders, resp=
ectively. The Committee determined, therefore, that with respect to Canadia=
n signals the compulsory license would apply in an area located 150 miles f=
rom the U.S.-Canadian border, or south from the border to the 42nd parallel=
 of latitude, whichever distance is greater. Thus the cities of Detroit, Pi=
ttsburgh, Cleveland, Green Bay and Seattle would be included within the com=
pulsory license area, while cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago,=
 and San Francisco would be located outside the area.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">With respect to Mexican signals, the Commission dete=
rmined that the compulsory license would apply only in the area in which su=
ch signals may be received by a U.S. cable system by means of direct interc=
eption of a free space radio wave. Thus, full copyright liability would app=
ly if a cable system were required to use any equipment or device other tha=
n a receiving antenna to bring the signal to the community of the cable sys=
tem.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Further, to take account of those cable systems that=
 are presently carrying or are specifically authorized to carry Canadian or=
 Mexican signals, pursuant to FCC rules and regulations, and whether or not=
 within the zones established, the Committee determined to grant a compulso=
ry license for the carriage of those specific signals on those cable system=
s as in effect on April 15, 1976.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee wishes to stress that cable systems op=
erating within these zones are fully subject to the payment of royalty fees=
 under the compulsory license for those foreign signals retransmitted. The =
copyright owners of the works transmitted may appear before the Copyright R=
oyalty Commission and, pursuant to the provisions of this legislation, file=
 claims to their fair share of the royalties collected. Outside the zones, =
however, full copyright liability would apply as would all the remedies of =
the legislation for any act of infringement.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Requirements for a Compulsory License.</stro=
ng> The compulsory license provided for in section 111(c) is contingent upo=
n fulfillment of the requirements set forth in section 111(d). Subsection (=
d)(1) directs that at least one month before the commencement of operations=
, or within 180 days after the enactment of this act [Oct. 19, 1976], which=
ever is later, a cable system must record in the Copyright Office a notice,=
 including a statement giving the identity and address of the person who ow=
ns or operates the secondary transmission service or who has power to exerc=
ise primary control over it, together with the name and location of the pri=
mary transmitter whose signals are regularly carried by the cable system. S=
ignals "regularly carried" by the system mean those signals which the Feder=
al Communications Commission has specifically authorized the cable system t=
o carry, and which are actually carried by the system on a regular basis. I=
t is also required that whenever the ownership or control or regular signal=
 carriage complement of the system changes, the cable system must within 30=
 days record any such changes in the Copyright Office. Cable systems must a=
lso record such further information as the Register of Copyrights shall pre=
scribe by regulation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (d)(2) directs cable systems whose second=
ary transmissions have been subject to compulsory licensing under subsectio=
n (c) to deposit with the Register of Copyrights a semi-annual statement of=
 account. The dates for filing such statements of account and the six-month=
 period which they are to cover are to be determined by the Register of Cop=
yrights after consultation with the Copyright Royalty Commission. In additi=
on to other such information that the Register may prescribe by regulation,=
 the statements of account are to specify the number of channels on which t=
he cable system made secondary transmissions to its subscribers, the names =
and locations of all primary transmitters whose transmissions were carried =
by the system, the total number of subscribers to the system, and the gross=
 amounts paid to the system for the basic service of providing secondary tr=
ansmissions. If any non-network television programming was retransmitted by=
 the cable system beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter,=
 pursuant to the rules of the Federal Communications Commission, which unde=
r certain circumstances permit the substitution or addition of television s=
ignals not regularly carried, the cable system must deposit a special state=
ment of account listing the times, dates, stations and programs involved in=
 such substituted or added carriage.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Copyright Royalty Payments.</strong> Subsect=
ion (d)(2)(B), (C) and (D) require cable systems to deposit royalty fee pay=
ments for the period covered by the statements of account. These payments a=
re to be computed on the basis of specified percentages of the gross receip=
ts from cable subscribers during the period covered by the statement. For p=
urposes of computing royalty payments, only receipts for the basic service =
of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters are =
to be considered. Other receipts from subscribers, such as those for pay-ca=
ble services or installation charges, are not included in gross receipts.</=
p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (d)(2)(B) provides that, except in the ca=
se of a cable system that comes within the gross receipts limitations of su=
bclauses (C) and (D), the royalty fee is computed in the following manner:<=
/p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Every cable system pays .675 of 1 percent of its gro=
ss receipts for the privilege of retransmitting distant non-network program=
ming, such amount to be applied against the fee, if any, payable under the =
computation for "distant signal equivalents." The latter are determined by =
adding together the values assigned to the actual number of distant televis=
ion stations carried by a cable system. The purpose of this initial rate, a=
pplicable to all cable systems in this class, is to establish a basic payme=
nt, whether or not a particular cable system elects to transmit distant non=
-network programming. It is not a payment for the retransmission of purely =
"local" signals, as is evident from the provision that it applies to and is=
 deductible from the fee payable for any "distant signal equivalents."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The remaining provisions of subclause (B) establish =
the following rates for "distant signal equivalents:"</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The rate from zero to one distant signal equivalent =
is .675 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues. An additional .425 of 1 =
percent of gross subscriber revenues is to be paid for each of the second, =
third and fourth distant signal equivalents that are carried. A further pay=
ment of .2 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues is to be made for each=
 distant signal equivalent after the fourth. Any fraction of a distant sign=
al equivalent is to be computed at its fractional value and where a cable s=
ystem is located partly within and partly without the local service area of=
 a primary transmitter, the gross receipts subject to the percentage paymen=
t are limited to those gross receipts derived from subscribers located with=
out the local service area of such primary transmitter.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Pursuant to the foregoing formula, copyright payment=
s as a percentage of gross receipts increase as the <!-- PDFPage:52 -->numb=
er of distant television signals carried by a cable system increases. Becau=
se many smaller cable systems carry a large number of distant signals, espe=
cially those located in areas where over-the-air television service is spar=
se, and because smaller cable systems may be less able to shoulder the burd=
en of copyright payments than larger systems, the Committee decided to give=
 special consideration to cable systems with semi-annual gross subscriber r=
eceipts of less than $160,000 ($320,000 annually). The royalty fee schedule=
s for cable systems in this category are specified in subclauses (C) and (D=
).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In lieu of the payments required in subclause (B), s=
ystems earning less than $80,000, semi-annually, are to pay a royalty fee o=
f .5 of 1 percent of gross receipts. Gross receipts under this provision ar=
e computed, however, by subtracting from actual gross receipts collected du=
ring the payment period the amount by which $80,000 exceeds such actual gro=
ss receipts. Thus, if the actual gross receipts of the cable system for the=
 period covered are $60,000, the fee is determined by subtracting $20,000 (=
the amount by which $80,000 exceeds actual gross receipts) from $60,000 and=
 applying .5 of 1 percent to the $40,000 result. However, gross receipts in=
 no case are to be reduced to less than $3,000.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under subclause (D), cable systems with semi-annual =
gross subscriber receipts of between $80,000 and $160,000 are to pay royalt=
y fees of .5 of 1 percent of such actual gross receipts up to $80,000, and =
1 percent of any actual gross receipts in excess of $80,000. The royalty fe=
e payments under both subclauses (C) and (D) are to be determined without r=
egard to the number of distant signal equivalents, if any, carried by the s=
ubject cable systems.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Copyright Royalty Distribution.</strong> Sec=
tion 111(d)(3) provides that the royalty fees paid by cable systems under t=
he compulsory license shall be received by the Register of Copyrights and, =
after deducting the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office, depo=
sited in the Treasury of the United States. The fees are distributed subseq=
uently, pursuant to the determination of the Copyright Royalty Commission u=
nder chapter 8 [=C2=A7801 et seq. of this title].</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The copyright owners entitled to participate in the =
distribution of the royalty fees paid by cable systems under the compulsory=
 license are specified in section 111(d)(4). Consistent with the Committee'=
s view that copyright royalty fees should be made only for the retransmissi=
on of distant non-network programming, the claimants are limited to (1) cop=
yright owners whose works were included in a secondary transmission made by=
 a cable system of a distant non-network television program; (2) any copyri=
ght owner whose work is included in a secondary transmission identified in =
a special statement of account deposited under section 111(d)(2)(A); and (3=
) any copyright owner whose work was included in distant non-network progra=
mming consisting exclusively of aural signals. Thus, no royalty fees may be=
 claimed or distributed to copyright owners for the retransmission of eithe=
r "local" or "network" programs.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee recognizes that the bill does not incl=
ude specific provisions to guide the Copyright Royalty Commission in determ=
ining the appropriate division among competing copyright owners of the roya=
lty fees collected from cable systems under Section 111. The Committee conc=
luded that it would not be appropriate to specify particular, limiting stan=
dards for distribution. Rather, the Committee believes that the Copyright R=
oyalty Commission should consider all pertinent data and considerations pre=
sented by the claimants.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Should disputes arise, however, between the differen=
t classes of copyright claimants, the Committee believes that the Copyright=
 Royalty Commission should consider that with respect to the copyright owne=
rs of "live" programs identified by the special statement of account deposi=
ted under Section 111(d)(2)(A), a special payment is provided in Section 11=
1(f).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 111(d)(5) sets forth the procedure for the d=
istribution of the royalty fees paid by cable systems. During the month of =
July of each year, every person claiming to be entitled to compulsory licen=

nce with such provisions as the Commission shall establish. In particular, =
the Commission may establish the relevant period covered by such claims aft=
er giving adequate time for copyright owners to review and consider the sta=
tements of account filed by cable systems. Notwithstanding any provisions o=
f the antitrust laws, the claimants may agree among themselves as to the di=
vision and distribution of such fees. After the first day of August of each=
 year, the Copyright Royalty Commission shall determine whether a controver=
sy exists concerning the distribution of royalty fees. If no controversy ex=
ists, the Commission, after deducting its reasonable administrative costs, =
shall distribute the fees to the copyright owners entitled or their agents.=
 If the Commission finds the existence of a controversy, it shall, pursuant=
 to the provisions of chapter 8 [=C2=A7801 et seq. of this title], conduct =
a proceeding to determine the distribution of royalty fees.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Off-Shore Taping by Cable Systems.</strong> =
Section 111(e) establishes the conditions and limitation upon which certain=
 cable systems located outside the continental United States, and specified=
 in subsection (f), may make tapes of copyrighted programs and retransmit t=
he taped programs to their subscribers upon payment of the compulsory licen=
se fee. These conditions and limitations include compliance with detailed t=
ransmission, record keeping, and other requirements. Their purpose is to co=
ntrol carefully the use of any tapes made pursuant to the limited recording=
 and retransmission authority established in subsection (f), and to insure =
that the limited objective of assimilating offshore cable systems to system=
s within the United States for purposes of the compulsory license is not ex=
ceeded. Any secondary transmission by a cable system entitled to the benefi=
ts of the taping authorization that does not comply with the requirements o=
f section 111(e) is an act of infringement and is fully subject to all the =
remedies provided in the legislation for such actions.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Definitions.</strong> Section 111(f) contain=
s a series of definitions. These definitions are found in subsection (f) ra=
ther than in section 101 because of their particular application to seconda=
ry transmissions by cable systems.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Primary and Secondary Transmissions</i>. The defi=
nitions of "primary transmission" and "secondary transmission" have been di=
scussed above. The definition of "secondary transmission" also contains a p=
rovision permitting the nonsimultaneous retransmission of a primary transmi=
ssion if by a cable system "not located in whole or in part within the boun=
dary of the forty-eight contiguous states, Hawaii or Puerto Rico." Under a =
proviso, however, a cable system in Hawaii may make a nonsimultaneous retra=
nsmission of a primary transmission if the carriage of the television broad=
cast signal comprising such further transmission is permissible under the r=
ules, regulations or authorizations of the FCC.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The effect of this definition is to permit certain c=
able systems in offshore areas, but not including cable systems in the offs=
hore area of Puerto Rico and to a limited extent only in Hawaii, to tape pr=
ograms and retransmit them to subscribers under the compulsory license. Pue=
rto Rico was excluded based upon a communication the Committee received fro=
m the Governor of Puerto Rico stating that the particular television broadc=
asting problems which the definition seeks to solve for cable systems in ot=
her noncontiguous areas do not exist in Puerto Rico. He therefore requested=
 that Puerto Rico be excluded from the scope of the definition. All cable s=
ystems covered by the definition are subject to the conditions and limitati=
ons for nonsimultaneous transmissions established in section 111(e).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Cable System</i>. The definition of a "cable syst=
em" establishes that it is a facility that in whole or in part receives sig=
nals of one or more television broadcast stations licensed by the FCC and m=
akes secondary transmissions of such signals to subscribing members <!-- PD=
FPage:53 -->of the public who pay for such service. A closed circuit wire s=
ystem that only originates programs and does not carry television broadcast=
 signals would not come within the definition. Further, the definition prov=
ides that, in determining the applicable royalty fee and system classificat=
ion under subsection (d)(2)(B), (C), or (D) cable systems in contiguous com=
munities under common ownership or control or operating from one headend ar=
e considered as one system.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Local Service Area of a Primary Transmitter</i>. =
The definition of "local service area of a primary transmitter" establishes=
 the difference between "local" and "distant" signals and therefore the lin=
e between signals which are subject to payment under the compulsory license=
 and those that are not. It provides that the local service area of a telev=
ision broadcast station is the area in which the station is entitled to ins=
ist upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to FCC r=
ules and regulations. Under FCC rules and regulations this so-called "must =
carry" area is defined based on the market size and position of cable syste=
ms in 47 C.F.R. =C2=A7=C2=A776.57, 76.59, 76.61 and 76.63. The definition i=
s limited, however, to the FCC rules in effect on April 15, 1976. The purpo=
se of this limitation is to insure that any subsequent rule amendments by t=
he FCC that either increase or decrease the size of the local service area =
for its purposes do not change the definition for copyright purposes. The C=
ommittee believes that any such change for copyright purposes, which would =
materially affect the royalty fee payments provided in the legislation, sho=
uld only be made by an amendment to the statute.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The "local service area of a primary transmitter" of=
 a Canadian or Mexican television station is defined as the area in which s=
uch station would be entitled to insist upon its signals being retransmitte=
d if it were a television broadcast station subject to FCC rules and regula=
tions. Since the FCC does not permit a television station licensed in a for=
eign country to assert a claim to carriage by a U.S. cable system, the loca=
l service area of such foreign station is considered to be the same area as=
 if it were a U.S. station.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The local service area for a radio broadcast station=
 is defined to mean "the primary service area of such station pursuant to t=
he rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission." The ter=
m "primary service area" is defined precisely by the FCC with regard to AM =
stations in Section 73.11(a) of the FCC's rules. In the case of FM stations=
, "primary service area" is regarded by the FCC as the area included within=
 the field strength contours specified in Section 73.311 of its rules.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Distant Signal Equivalent</i>. The definition of =
a "distant signal equivalent" is central to the computation of the royalty =
fees payable under the compulsory license. It is the value assigned to the =
secondary transmission of any non-network television programming carried by=
 a cable system, in whole or in part, beyond the local service area of the =
primary transmitter of such programming. It is computed by assigning a valu=
e of one (1) to each distant independent station and a value of one-quarter=
 (=C2=BC) to each distant network station and distant noncommercial educati=
onal station carried by a cable system, pursuant to the rules and regulatio=
ns of the FCC. Thus, a cable system carrying two distant independent statio=
ns, two distant network stations and one distant noncommercial educational =
station would have a total of 2.75 distant signal equivalents.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The values assigned to independent, network and nonc=
ommercial educational stations are subject, however, to certain exceptions =
and limitations. Two of these relate to the mandatory and discretionary pro=
gram deletion and substitution rules of the FCC. Where the FCC rules requir=
e a cable system to omit certain programs (e.g., the syndicated program exc=
lusivity rules) and also permit the substitution of another program in plac=
e of the omitted program, no additional value is assigned for the substitut=
ed or additional program. Further, where the FCC rules on the date of enact=
ment of this legislation permit a cable system, at its discretion, to make =
such deletions or substitutions or to carry additional programs not transmi=
tted by primary transmitters within whose local service area the cable syst=
em is located, no additional value is assigned for the substituted or addit=
ional programs. However, the latter discretionary exception is subject to a=
 condition that if the substituted or additional program is a "live" progra=
m (e.g., a sports event), then an additional value is assigned to the carri=
age of the distant signal computed as a fraction of one distant signal equi=
valent. The fraction is determined by assigning to the numerator the number=
 of days in the year on which the "live" substitution occurs, and by assign=
ing to the denominator the number of days in the year. Further, the discret=
ionary exception is limited to those FCC rules in effect on the date of ena=
ctment of this legislation [Oct. 19, 1976]. If subsequent FCC rule amendmen=
ts or individual authorizations enlarge the discretionary ability of cable =
systems to delete and substitute programs, such deletions and substitutions=
 would be counted at the full value assigned the particular type of station=
 provided above.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Two further exceptions pertain to the late-night or =
specialty programming rules of the FCC or to a station carried on a part-ti=
me basis where full-time carriage is not possible because the cable system =
lacks the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis all=
 signals which it is authorized to carry. In this event, the values for ind=
ependent, network and noncommercial, educational stations set forth above, =
as the case may be, are determined by multiplying each by a fraction which =
is equal to the ratio of the broadcast hours of such station carried by the=
 cable system to the total broadcast hours of the station.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Network Station</i>. A "network station" is defin=
ed as a television broadcast station that is owned or operated by, or affil=
iated with, one or more of the U.S. television networks providing nationwid=
e transmissions and that transmits a substantial part of the programming su=
pplied by such networks for a substantial part of that station's typical br=
oadcast day. To qualify as a network station, all the conditions of the def=
inition must be met. Thus, the retransmission of a Canadian station affilia=
ted with a Canadian network would not qualify under the definition. Further=
, a station affiliated with a regional network would not qualify, since a r=
egional network would not provide nationwide transmissions. However, a stat=
ion affiliated with a network providing nationwide transmissions that also =
occasionally carries regional programs would qualify as a "network station,=
" if the station transmits a substantial part of the programming supplied b=
y the network for a substantial part of the station's typical broadcast day=
.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Independent Station</i>. An "independent station"=
 is defined as a commercial television broadcast station other than a netwo=
rk station. Any commercial station that does not fall within the definition=
 of "network station" is classified as an "independent station."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Noncommercial Educational Station</i>. A "noncomm=
ercial educational station" is defined as a television station that is a no=
ncommercial educational broadcast station within the meaning of section 397=
 of title 47 [47 U.S.C. 397].</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 112 of the bill concerns itself with a speci=
al problem that is not dealt with in the present statutes but is the subjec=
t of provisions in a number of foreign statutes and in the revisions of the=
 Berne Convention since 1948. This is the problem of what are commonly call=
ed "ephemeral recordings": copies or phonorecords of a work made for purpos=
es of later transmission by a broadcasting organization legally entitled to=
 transmit the work. In other words, where a broadcaster has the privilege o=
f performing or displaying a work either because he is licensed or because =
the performance or display is exempted under the statute, the question is w=
hether he should be given the additional privilege of recording the perform=
ance or display to facilitate its transmission. The need for a limited exem=
ption in these cases because of the practical exigencies of broadcasting ha=
s been generally recognized, but the scope of the exemption has been a cont=
roversial issue.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Recordings for Licensed Transmissions.</stro=
ng> Under subsection (a) of section 112, an organization that has acquired =
the right to transmit any work (other than a motion picture or other audiov=
isual work), or that is free to transmit a sound recording under section 11=
4, may make a single copy or phonorecord of a particular program embodying =
the work, if the copy or phonorecord is used solely for the organization's =
own transmissions within its own area; after 6 months it must be destroyed =
or preserved solely for archival purposes.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Organizations Covered</i>.=E2=80=94The ephemeral =
recording privilege is given by subsection (a) to "a transmitting organizat=
ion entitled to transmit to the public a performance or display of a work."=
 Assuming that the transmission meets the other conditions of the provision=
, it makes no difference what type of public transmission the organization =
is making: commercial radio and television broadcasts, public radio and tel=
evision broadcasts not exempted by section 110(2), pay-TV, closed circuit, =
background music, and so forth. However, to come within the scope of subsec=
tion (a), the organization must have the right to make the transmission "un=
der a license or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on excl=
usive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a)." Thus, except=
 in the case of copyrighted sound recordings (which have no exclusive perfo=
rming rights under the bill), the organization must be a transferee or lice=
nsee (including compulsory licensee) of performing rights in the work in or=
der to make an ephemeral recording of it.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Some concern has been expressed by authors and publi=
shers lest the term "organization" be construed to include a number of affi=
liated broadcasters who could exchange the recording without restrictions. =
The term is intended to cover a broadcasting network, or a local broadcaste=
r or individual transmitter; but, under clauses (1) and (2) of the subsecti=
on, the ephemeral recording must be "retained and used solely by the transm=
itting organization that made it," and must be used solely for that organiz=
ation's own transmissions within <!-- PDFPage:60 -->its own area. Thus, an =
ephemeral recording made by one transmitter, whether it be a network or loc=
al broadcaster, could not be made available for use by another transmitter.=
 Likewise, this subsection does not apply to those nonsimultaneous transmis=
sions by cable systems not located within a boundary of the forty-eight con=
tiguous States that are granted a compulsory license under section 111.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Scope of the Privilege</i>.=E2=80=94Subsection (a=
) permits the transmitting organization to make "no more than one copy or p=
honorecord of a particular transmission program embodying the performance o=
r display." A "transmission program" is defined in section 101 as a body of=
 material produced for the sole purpose of transmission as a unit. Thus, un=
der section 112(a), a transmitter could make only one copy or phonorecord o=
f a particular "transmission program" containing a copyrighted work, but wo=
uld not be limited as to the number of times the work itself could be dupli=
cated as part of other "transmission programs."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Three specific limitations on the scope of the ephem=
eral recording privilege are set out in subsection (a), and unless all are =
met the making of an "ephemeral recording" becomes fully actionable as an i=
nfringement. The first requires that the copy or phonorecord be "retained a=
nd used solely by the transmitting organization that made it," and that "no=
 further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it." This means that a =
transmitting organization would have no privilege of exchanging ephemeral r=
ecordings with other transmitters or of allowing them to duplicate their ow=
n ephemeral recordings from the copy or phonorecord it has made. There is n=
othing in the provision to prevent a transmitting organization from having =
an ephemeral recording made by means of facilities other than its own, alth=
ough it would not be permissible for a person or organization other than a =
transmitting organization to make a recording on its own initiative for pos=
sible sale or lease to a broadcaster. The ephemeral recording privilege wou=
ld extend to copies or phonorecords made in advance for later broadcast, as=
 well as recordings of a program that are made while it is being transmitte=
d and are intended for deferred transmission or preservation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (2) of section 112(a) provides that, to be ex=
empt from copyright, the copy or phonorecord must be "used solely for the t=
ransmitting organization's own transmissions within its local service area,=
 or for purposes of archival preservation or security". The term "local ser=
vice area" is defined in section 111(f).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (3) of section 112(a) provides that, unless p=
reserved exclusively for archival purposes, the copy or phonorecord of a tr=
ansmission program must be destroyed within six months from the date the tr=
ansmission program was first transmitted to the public.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Recordings for Instructional Transmissions.<=
/strong> Section 112(b) represents a response to the arguments of instructi=
onal broadcasters and other educational groups for special recording privil=
eges, although it does not go as far as these groups requested. In general,=
 it permits a nonprofit organization that is free to transmit a performance=
 or display of a work, under section 110(2) or under the limitations on exc=
lusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a), to make not =
more than thirty copies or phonorecords and to use the ephemeral recordings=
 for transmitting purposes for not more than seven years after the initial =
transmission.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Organizations Covered</i>.=E2=80=94The privilege =
of making ephemeral recordings under section 112(b) extends to a "governmen=
tal body or other nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance=
 or display of a work under section 110(2) or under the limitations on excl=
usive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a)." Aside from p=
honorecords of copyrighted sound recordings, the ephemeral recordings made =
by an instructional broadcaster under subsection (b) must embody a performa=
nce or display that meets all of the qualifications for exemption under sec=
tion 110(2). Copies or phonorecords made for educational broadcasts of a ge=
neral cultural nature, or for transmission as part of an information storag=
e and retrieval system, would not be exempted from copyright protection und=
er section 112(b).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works</i>.=
=E2=80=94Since the performance exemption provided by section 110(2) applies=
 only to nondramatic literary and musical works, there was no need to exclu=
de motion pictures and other audiovisual works explicitly from the scope of=
 section 112(b). Another point stressed by the producers of educational fil=
ms in this connection, however, was that ephemeral recordings made by instr=
uctional broadcasters are in fact audiovisual works that often compete for =
exactly the same market. They argued that it is unfair to allow instruction=
al broadcasters to reproduce multiple copies of films and tapes, and to exc=
hange them with other broadcasters, without paying any copyright royalties,=
 thereby directly injuring the market of producers of audiovisual works who=
 now pay substantial fees to authors for the same uses. These arguments are=
 persuasive and justify the placing of reasonable limits on the recording p=
rivilege.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Scope of the Privilege</i>.=E2=80=94Under subsect=
ion (b) an instructional broadcaster may make "no more than thirty copies o=
r phonorecords of a particular transmission program embodying the performan=
ce or display." No further copies or phonorecords can be reproduced from th=
ose made under section 112(b), either by the nonprofit organization that ma=
de them or by anyone else.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">On the other hand, if the nonprofit organization doe=
s nothing directly or indirectly to authorize, induce, or encourage others =
to duplicate additional copies or phonorecords of an ephemeral recording in=
 excess of the limit of thirty, it would not be held responsible as partici=
pating in the infringement in such a case, and the unauthorized copies woul=
d not be counted against the organization's total of thirty.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Unlike ephemeral recordings made under subsection (a=
), exchanges of recordings among instructional broadcasters are permitted. =
An organization that has made copies or phonorecords under subsection (b) m=
ay use one of them for purposes of its own transmissions that are exempted =
by section 110(2), and it may also transfer the other 29 copies to other in=
structional broadcasters for use in the same way.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">As in the case of ephemeral recordings made under se=
ction 112(a), a copy or phonorecord made for instructional broadcasting cou=
ld be reused in any number of transmissions within the time limits specifie=
d in the provision. Because of the special problems of instructional broadc=
asters resulting from the scheduling of courses and the need to prerecord w=
ell in advance of transmission, the period of use has been extended to seve=
n years from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the=
 public.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Religious Broadcasts</i>.=E2=80=94Section 112(c) =
provides that it is not an infringement of copyright for certain nonprofit =
organizations to make no more than one copy for each transmitting organizat=
ion of a broadcast program embodying a performance of a nondramatic musical=
 work of a religious nature or of a sound recording of such a musical work.=
 In order for this exception to be applicable there must be no charge for t=
he distribution of the copies, none of the copies may be used for any perfo=
rmance other than a single transmission by an organization possessing a lic=
ense to transmit a copyrighted work, and, other than for one copy that may =
be preserved for archival purposes, the remaining copies must be destroyed =
within one year from the date the program was first transmitted to the publ=
ic.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Despite objections by music copyright owners, the Co=
mmittee found this exemption to be justified by the special circumstances u=
nder which many religious programs are broadcast. These programs are produc=
ed on tape or disk for distribution by mail of one copy only to each broadc=
ast station carrying the program. None of the programs are prepared for pro=
fit, and the program producer either pays the station to carry the program =
or furnishes it free of charge. The stations have performing licenses, so t=
he copyright owners receive compensation. Following the performance, the ta=
pe is <!-- PDFPage:61 -->returned or the disk destroyed. It seems likely th=
at, as has been alleged, to require a second payment for the mechanical rep=
roduction under these circumstances would simply have the effect of driving=
 some of the copyrighted music off the air.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Ephemeral Recordings for Transmissions to Ha=
ndicapped Audiences.</strong> As a counterpart to its amendment of section =
110(8), the Committee adopted a new provision, subsection (d) of section 11=
2, to provide an ephemeral recording exemption in the case of transmissions=
 to the blind and deaf. New subsection would permit the making of one recor=
ding of a performance exempted under section 110(8), and its retention for =
an unlimited period. It would not permit the making of further reproduction=
s or their exchange with other organizations.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Copyright Status of Ephemeral Recordings.</s=
trong> A program reproduced in an ephemeral recording made under section 11=
2 in many cases will constitute a motion picture, a sound recording, or som=
e other kind of derivative work, and will thus be potentially copyrightable=
 under section 103. In section 112(e) it is provided that ephemeral recordi=
ngs are not to be copyrightable as derivative works except with the consent=
 of the owners of the copyrighted material employed in them.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 113 deals with the extent of copyright prote=
ction in "works of applied art." The section takes as its starting point th=
e Supreme Court's decision in <i>Mazer v. Stein</i>, 347 U.S. 201 (1954) [7=
4 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630, rehearing denied 74 S.Ct. 637, 347 U.S. 949, 98 =
L.Ed. 1096], and the first sentence of subsection (a) restates the basic pr=
inciple established by that decision. The rule of <i>Mazer</i>, as affirmed=
 by the bill, is that copyright in a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work=
 will not be affected if the work is employed as the design of a useful art=
icle, and will afford protection to the copyright owner against the unautho=
rized reproduction of his work in useful as well as nonuseful articles. The=
 terms "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" and "useful article" are =
defined in section 101, and these definitions are discussed above in connec=
tion with section 102.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The broad language of section 106(1) and of subsecti=
on (a) of section 113 raises questions as to the extent of copyright protec=
tion for a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that portrays, depicts, o=
r represents an image of a useful article in such a way that the utilitaria=
n nature of the article can be seen. To take the example usually cited, wou=
ld copyright in a drawing or model of an automobile give the artist the exc=
lusive right to make automobiles of the same design?</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The 1961 Report of the Register of Copyrights stated=
, on the basis of judicial precedent, that "copyright in a pictorial, graph=
ic, or sculptural work, portraying a useful article as such, does not exten=
d to the manufacture of the useful article itself," and recommended specifi=
cally that "the distinctions drawn in this area by existing court decisions=
" not be altered by the statute. The Register's Supplementary Report, at pa=
ge 48, cited a number of these decisions, and explained the insuperable dif=
ficulty of finding "any statutory formulation that would express the distin=
ction satisfactorily." Section 113(b) reflects the Register's conclusion th=
at "the real need is to make clear that there is no intention to change the=
 present law with respect to the scope of protection in a work portraying a=
 useful article as such."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 113(c) provides that it would not be an infr=
ingement of copyright, where a copyright work has been lawfully published a=
s the design of useful articles, to make, distribute or display pictures of=
 the articles in advertising, in feature stories about the articles, or in =
the news reports.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In conformity with its deletion from the bill of Tit=
le II, relating to the protection of ornamental designs of useful articles,=
 the Committee has deleted subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 113 of =
S. 22 as adopted by the Senate, since they are no longer relevant.</p>

<p class=3D"statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.=
=E2=80=94As used in this section, the following terms have the following me=
anings:</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(1) An "affiliated entity" is an entity eng=
aging in digital audio transmissions covered by section 106(6), other than =
an interactive service, in which the licensor has any direct or indirect pa=
rtnership or any ownership interest amounting to 5 percent or more of the o=
utstanding voting or non-voting stock.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(2) An "archived program" is a predetermine=
d program that is available repeatedly on the demand of the transmission re=
cipient and that is performed in the same order from the beginning, except =
that an archived program <!-- PDFPage:71 -->shall not include a recorded ev=
ent or broadcast transmission that makes no more than an incidental use of =
sound recordings, as long as such recorded event or broadcast transmission =
does not contain an entire sound recording or feature a particular sound re=
cording.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(3) A "broadcast" transmission is a transmi=
ssion made by a terrestrial broadcast station licensed as such by the Feder=
al Communications Commission.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(4) A "continuous program" is a predetermin=
ed program that is continuously performed in the same order and that is acc=
essed at a point in the program that is beyond the control of the transmiss=
ion recipient.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(5) A "digital audio transmission" is a dig=
ital transmission as defined in section 101, that embodies the transmission=
 of a sound recording. This term does not include the transmission of any a=
udiovisual work.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(6) An "eligible nonsubscription transmissi=
on" is a noninteractive nonsubscription digital audio transmission not exem=
pt under subsection (d)(1) that is made as part of a service that provides =
audio programming consisting, in whole or in part, of performances of sound=
 recordings, including retransmissions of broadcast transmissions, if the p=
rimary purpose of the service is to provide to the public such audio or oth=
er entertainment programming, and the primary purpose of the service is not=
 to sell, advertise, or promote particular products or services other than =
sound recordings, live concerts, or other music-related events.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(7) An "interactive service" is one that en=
ables a member of the public to receive a transmission of a program special=
ly created for the recipient, or on request, a transmission of a particular=
 sound recording, whether or not as part of a program, which is selected by=
 or on behalf of the recipient. The ability of individuals to request that =
particular sound recordings be performed for reception by the public at lar=
ge, or in the case of a subscription service, by all subscribers of the ser=
vice, does not make a service interactive, if the programming on each chann=
el of the service does not substantially consist of sound recordings that a=
re performed within 1 hour of the request or at a time designated by either=
 the transmitting entity or the individual making such request. If an entit=
y offers both interactive and noninteractive services (either concurrently =
or at different times), the noninteractive component shall not be treated a=
s part of an interactive service.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(8) A "new subscription service" is a servi=
ce that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive subscription d=
igital audio transmissions and that is not a preexisting subscription servi=
ce or a preexisting satellite digital audio radio service.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(9) A "nonsubscription" transmission is any=
 transmission that is not a subscription transmission.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(10) A "preexisting satellite digital audio=
 radio service" is a subscription satellite digital audio radio service pro=
vided pursuant to a satellite digital audio radio service license issued by=
 the Federal Communications Commission on or before July 31, 1998, and any =
renewal of such license to the extent of the scope of the original license,=
 and may include a limited number of sample channels representative of the =
subscription service that are made available on a nonsubscription basis in =
order to promote the subscription service.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(11) A "preexisting subscription service" i=
s a service that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive audio=
-only subscription digital audio transmissions, which was in existence and =
was making such transmissions to the public for a fee on or before July 31,=
 1998, and may include a limited number of sample channels representative o=
f the subscription service that are made available on a nonsubscription bas=
is in order to promote the subscription service.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(12) A "retransmission" is a further transm=
ission of an initial transmission, and includes any further retransmission =
of the same transmission. Except as provided in this section, a transmissio=
n qualifies as a "retransmission" only if it is simultaneous with the initi=
al transmission. Nothing in this definition shall be construed to exempt a =
transmission that fails to satisfy a separate element required to qualify f=
or an exemption under section 114(d)(1).</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(13) The "sound recording performance compl=
ement" is the transmission during any 3-hour period, on a particular channe=
l used by a transmitting entity, of no more than=E2=80=94</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-2em">(A) 3 different selections of sound recordi=

or</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-3em">(ii) from any set or compilation of phonore=
cords lawfully distributed together as a unit for public performance or sal=
e in the United States,</p>

A) and (B) from multiple phonorecords shall nonetheless qualify as a sound =
recording performance complement if the programming of the multiple phonore=
cords was not willfully intended to avoid the numerical limitations prescri=
bed in such clauses.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(14) A "subscription" transmission is a tra=
nsmission that is controlled and limited to particular recipients, and for =
which consideration is required to be paid or otherwise given by or on beha=
lf of the recipient to receive the transmission or a package of transmissio=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (a) of Section 114 specified that the exc=
lusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording are limited to=
 the rights to reproduce the sound recording in copies or phonorecords, to =
prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted sound recording, and to d=
istribute copies or phonorecords of the sound recording to the public. Subs=
ection (a) states explicitly that the owner's rights "do not include any ri=
ght of performance under section 106(4)." The Committee considered at lengt=
h the arguments in favor of establishing a limited performance right, in th=
e form of a compulsory license, for copyrighted sound recordings, but concl=
uded that the problem requires further study. It therefore added a new subs=
ection (d) to the bill requiring the Register of Copyrights to submit to Co=
ngress, on January 3, 1978, "a report setting forth recommendations as to w=
hether this section should be amended to provide for performers and copyrig=
ht owners *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* any performance rights" in copyrighted sound reco=
rdings. Under the new subsection, the report "should describe the status of=
 such rights in foreign countries, the views of major interested parties, a=
nd specific legislative or other recommendations, if any."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (b) of section 114 makes clear that statu=
tory protection for sound recordings extends only to the particular sounds =
of which the recording consists, and would not prevent a separate recording=
 of another performance in which those sounds are imitated. Thus, infringem=
ent takes place whenever all or any substantial portion of the actual sound=
s that go to make up a copyrighted sound recording are reproduced in phonor=
ecords by repressing, transcribing, recapturing off the air, or any other m=
ethod, or by reproducing them in the soundtrack or audio portion of a motio=
n picture or other audiovisual work. Mere imitation of a recorded performan=
ce would not constitute a copyright infringement even where one performer d=
eliberately sets out to simulate another's performance as exactly as possib=
le.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 114, the exclusive right of owner of c=
opyright in a sound recording to prepare derivative works based on the copy=
righted sound recording is recognized. However, in view of the expressed in=
tention not to give exclusive rights against imitative or simulated perform=
ances and recordings, the Committee adopted an amendment to make clear the =
scope of rights under section 106(2) in this context. Section 114(b) provid=
es that the "exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording=
 under clause (2) of section 106 is limited to the right to prepare a deriv=
ative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rear=
ranged, remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Another amendment deals with the use of copyrighted =
sound recordings "included in educational television and radio programs *&n=
bsp;*&nbsp;* distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting e=
ntities." This use of recordings is permissible without authorization from =
the owner of copyright in the sound recording, as long as "copies or phonor=
ecords of said programs are not commercially distributed by or through publ=
ic broadcasting entities to the general public."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">During the 1975 hearings, the Register of Copyrights=
 expressed some concern that an invaluable segment of this country's musica=
l heritage=E2=80=94in the form of sound recordings=E2=80=94had become inacc=
essible to musicologists and to others for scholarly purposes. Several of t=
he major recording companies have responded to the Register's concern by gr=
anting blanket licenses to the Library of Congress to permit it to make sin=
gle copy duplications of sound recordings maintained in the Library's archi=
ves for research purposes. Moreover, steps are being taken to determine the=
 feasibility of additional licensing arrangements as a means of satisfying =
the needs of key regional music libraries across the country. The Register =
has agreed to report to Congress if further legislative consideration shoul=
d be undertaken.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 114(c) states explicitly that nothing in the=
 provisions of section 114 should be construed to "limit or impair the excl=
usive right to perform publicly, by means of a phonorecord, any of the work=
s specified by section 106(4)." This principle is already implicit in the b=
ill, but it is restated to avoid the danger of confusion between rights in =
a sound recording and rights in the musical composition or other work embod=
ied in the recording.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">The provisions of section 1(e) and 101(e) of the pre=
sent law [sections 1(e) and 101(e) of former title 17], establishing a syst=
em of compulsory licensing for the making and distribution of phonorecords =
of copyrighted music, are retained with a number of modifications and clari=
fications in section 115 of the bill. Under these provisions, which represe=
nted a compromise of the most controversial issue of the 1909 act, a musica=
l composition that has been reproduced in phonorecords with the permission =
of the copyright owner may generally be reproduced in phonorecords by anoth=
er person, if that person notifies the copyright owner and pays a specified=
 royalty.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The fundamental question of whether to retain the co=
mpulsory license or to do away with it altogether was a major issue during =
earlier stages of the program for general revision of the copyright law. At=
 the hearings it was apparent that the argument on this point had shifted, =
and the real issue was not whether to retain the compulsory license but how=
 much the royalty rate under it should be. The arguments for and against re=
tention of the compulsory license are outlined at pages 66=E2=80=9367 of th=
is Committee's 1967 report (H. Rept. <!-- PDFPage:100 -->No. 83, 90th Cong.=
, 1st Sess.). The Committee's conclusion on this point remains the same as =
in 1967: "that a compulsory licensing system is still warranted as a condit=
ion for the rights of reproducing and distributing phonorecords of copyrigh=
ted music," but "that the present system is unfair and unnecessarily burden=
some on copyright owners, and that the present statutory rate is too low."<=
/p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Availability and Scope of Compulsory License=
.</strong> Subsection (a) of section 115 deals with three doubtful question=
s under the present law: (1) the nature of the original recording that will=
 make the work available to others for recording under a compulsory license=
; (2) the nature of the sound recording that can be made under a compulsory=
 license; and (3) the extent to which someone acting under a compulsory lic=
ense can depart from the work as written or recorded without violating the =
copyright owner's right to make an "arrangement" or other derivative work. =
The first two of these questions are answered in clause (1) of section 115(=
a), and the third is the subject of clause (2).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The present law, though not altogether clear, appare=
ntly bases compulsory licensing on the making or licensing of the first rec=
ording, even if no authorized records are distributed to the public. The fi=
rst sentence of section 115(a)(1) would change the basis for compulsory lic=
ensing to authorized public distribution of phonorecords (including disks a=
nd audio tapes but not the sound tracks or other sound records accompanying=
 a motion picture or other audiovisual work). Under the clause, a compulsor=
y license would be available to anyone as soon as "phonorecords of a nondra=
matic musical work have been distributed to the public in the United States=
 under the authority of the copyright owner."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The second sentence of clause (1), which has been th=
e subject of some debate, provides that "a person may obtain a compulsory l=
icense only if his or her primary purpose in making phonorecords is to dist=
ribute them to the public for private use." This provision was criticized a=
s being discriminatory against background music systems, since it would pre=
vent a background music producer from making recordings without the express=
 consent of the copyright owner; it was argued that this could put the prod=
ucer at a great competitive disadvantage with performing rights societies, =
allow discrimination, and destroy or prevent entry of businesses. The commi=
ttee concluded, however, that the purpose of the compulsory license does no=
t extend to manufacturers of phonorecords that are intended primarily for c=
ommercial use, including not only broadcasters and jukebox operators but al=
so background music services.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The final sentence of clause (1) provides that a per=
son may not obtain a compulsory license for use of the work in the duplicat=
ion of a sound recording made by another, unless the sound recording being =
duplicated was itself fixed lawfully and the making of phonorecords duplica=
ted from it was authorized by the owner of copyright in the sound recording=
 (or, if the recording was fixed before February 15, 1972, by the voluntary=
 or compulsory licensee of the music used in the recording). The basic inte=
nt of this sentence is to make clear that a person is not entitled to a com=
pulsory license of copyrighted musical works for the purpose of making an u=
nauthorized duplication of a musical sound recording originally developed a=
nd produced by another. It is the view of the Committee that such was the o=
riginal intent of the Congress in enacting the 1909 Copyright Act, and it h=
as been so construed by the 3d, 5th, 9th and 10th Circuits in the following=
 cases: <i>Duchess Music Corp. v. Stern</i>, 458 F.2d 1305 (9th Cir.), cert=
. denied, 409 U.S. 847 (1972) [93 S.Ct. 52, 34 L.Ed.2d 88]; <i>Edward B. Ma=
rks Music Corp. v. Colorado Magnetics, Inc</i>., 497 F.2d 285, aff'd on reh=
earing en banc, 497 F.2d 292 (10th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1120 =
(1975) [95 S.Ct. 801, 42 L.Ed.2d 819]; <i>Jondora Music Publishing Co. v. M=
elody Recordings, Inc</i>., 506 F.2d 392 (3d Cir. 1974, as amended 1975), c=
ert. denied, 421 U.S. 1012 (1975) [95 S.Ct. 2417, 44 L.Ed.2d 680]; and <i>F=
ame Publishing Co. v. Alabama Custom Tape, Inc</i>., 507 F.2d 667 (5th Cir.=
), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 841 (1975) [96 S.Ct. 73, 46 L.Ed.2d 61].</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under this provision, it would be possible to obtain=
 a compulsory license for the use of copyrighted music under section 115 if=
 the owner of the sound recording being duplicated authorizes its duplicati=
on. This does not, however, in any way require the owner of the original so=
und recording to grant a license to duplicate the original sound recording.=
 It is not intended that copyright protection for sound recordings be circu=
mscribed by requiring the owners of sound recordings to grant a compulsory =
license to unauthorized duplicators or others.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The second clause of subsection (a) is intended to r=
ecognize the practical need for a limited privilege to make arrangements of=
 music being used under a compulsory license, but without allowing the musi=
c to be perverted, distorted, or travestied. Clause (2) permits arrangement=
s of a work "to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner o=
f interpretation of the performance involved," so long as it does not "chan=
ge the basic melody or fundamental character of the work." The provision al=
so prohibits the compulsory licensee from claiming an independent copyright=
 in his arrangement as a "derivative work" without the express consent of t=
he copyright owner.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Procedure for Obtaining Compulsory License.<=
/strong> Section 115(b)(1) requires anyone who wishes to take advantage of =
the compulsory licensing provisions to serve a "notice of intention to obta=
in a compulsory license," which is much like the "notice of intention to us=
e" required by the present law. Under section 115, the notice must be serve=
d before any phonorecords are distributed, but service can take place "befo=
re or within 30 days after making" any phonorecords. The notice is to be se=
rved on the copyright owner, but if the owner is not identified in the Copy=
right Office records, "it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intenti=
on in the Copyright Office."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee deleted clause (2) of section 115(b) o=
f S. 22 as adopted by the Senate. The provision was a vestige of jukebox pr=
ovisions in earlier bills, and its requirements no longer served any useful=
 purpose.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (2) [formerly clause (3)] of section 115(b) [=
cl. (2) of subsec. (b) of this section] provides that "failure to serve or =
file the notice required by clause (1) *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* forecloses the possi=
bility of a compulsory license and, in the absence of a negotiated license,=
 renders the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of =
infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided b=
y sections 502 through 506." The remedies provided in section 501 are those=
 applicable to infringements generally.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License. <i=
>Identification of Copyright Owner</i></strong>.=E2=80=94Under the present =
law a copyright owner is obliged to file a "notice of use" in the Copyright=
 Office, stating that the initial recording of the copyrighted work has bee=
n made or licensed, in order to recover against an unauthorized record manu=
facturer. This requirement has resulted in a technical loss of rights in so=
me cases, and serves little or no purpose where the registration and assign=
ment records of the Copyright Office already show the facts of ownership. S=
ection 115(c)(1) therefore drops any formal "notice of use" requirements an=
d merely provides that, "to be entitled to receive royalties under a compul=
sory license, the copyright owner must be identified in the registration or=
 other public records of the Copyright Office." On the other hand, since pr=
oper identification is an important precondition of recovery, the bill furt=
her provides that "the owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords manu=
factured and distributed after being so identified, but is not entitled to =
recover for any phonorecords previously made and distributed."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Basis of Royalty</i>.=E2=80=94Under the present s=
tatute the specified royalty is payable "on each such part manufactured," r=
egardless of how many "parts" (i.e., records) are sold. This basis for calc=
ulating the royalty has been revised in section 115(c)(2) to provide that "=
the royalty under a compulsory license shall be payable for every phonoreco=
rd made and distributed in accordance with the license." This basis is more=
 compatible with the <!-- PDFPage:101 -->general practice in negotiated lic=
enses today. It is unjustified to require a compulsory licensee to pay lice=
nse fees on records which merely go into inventory, which may later be dest=
royed, and from which the record producer gains no economic benefit.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">It is intended that the Register of Copyrights will =
prescribe regulations insuring that copyright owners will receive full and =
prompt payment for all phonorecords made and distributed. Section 115(c)(2)=
 states that "a phonorecord is considered 'distributed' if the person exerc=
ising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with it=
s possession." For this purpose, the concept of "distribution" comprises an=
y act by which the person exercising the compulsory license voluntarily rel=
inquishes possession of a phonorecord (considered as a fungible unit), rega=
rdless of whether the distribution is to the public, passes title, constitu=
tes a gift, or is sold, rented, leased, or loaned, unless it is actually re=
turned and the transaction cancelled. Neither involuntary relinquishment, a=
s through theft or fire, nor the destruction of unwanted records, would con=
stitute "distribution."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The term "made" is intended to be broader than "manu=
factured," and to include within its scope every possible manufacturing or =
other process capable of reproducing a sound recording in phonorecords. The=
 use of the phrase "made and distributed" establishes the basis upon which =
the royalty rate for compulsory licensing under section 115 is to be calcul=
ated, but it is in no way intended to weaken the liability of record presse=
rs and other manufacturers and makers of phonorecords for copyright infring=
ement where the compulsory licensing requirements have not been met. As und=
er the present law, even if a presser, manufacturer, or other maker had no =
role in the distribution process, that person would be regarded as jointly =
and severally liable in a case where the court finds that infringement has =
taken place because of failure to comply with the provisions of section 115=
.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under existing practices in the record industry, pho=
norecords are distributed to wholesalers and retailers with the privilege o=
f returning unsold copies for credit or exchange. As a result, the number o=
f recordings that have been "permanently" distributed will not usually be k=
nown until some time=E2=80=94six or seven months on the average=E2=80=94aft=
er the initial distribution. In recognition of this problem, it has become =
a well-established industry practice, under negotiated licenses, for record=
 companies to maintain reasonable reserves of the mechanical royalties due =
the copyright owners, against which royalties on the returns can be offset.=
 The Committee recognizes that this practice may be consistent with the sta=
tutory requirements for monthly compulsory license accounting reports, but =
recognizes the possibility that, without proper safeguards, the maintenance=
 of such reserves could be manipulated to avoid making payments of the full=
 amounts owing to copyright owners. Under these circumstances, the regulati=
ons prescribed by the Register of Copyrights should contain detailed provis=
ions ensuring that the ultimate disposition of every phonorecord made under=
 a compulsory license is accounted for, and that payment is made for every =
phonorecord "voluntarily and permanently" distributed. In particular, the R=
egister should prescribe a point in time when, for accounting purposes unde=
r section 115, a phonorecord will be considered "permanently distributed," =
and should prescribe the situations in which a compulsory licensee is barre=
d from maintaining reserves (e.g., situations in which the compulsory licen=
see has frequently failed to make payments in the past.)</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><i>Rate of Royalty</i>.=E2=80=94A large preponderanc=
e of the extensive testimony presented to the Committee on section 115 was =
devoted to the question of the amount of the statutory royalty rate. An ext=
ensive review and analysis of the testimony and arguments received on this =
question appear in the 1974 Senate report (S. Rep. No. 94=E2=80=93473) at p=
age 71=E2=80=9394.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">While upon initial review it might be assumed that t=
he rate established in 1909 would not be reasonable at the present time, th=
e committee believes that an increase in the mechanical royalty rate must b=
e justified on the basis of existing economic conditions and not on the mer=
e passage of 67 years. Following a thorough analysis of the problem, the Co=
mmittee considers that an increase of the present two-cent royalty to a rat=
e of 2=C2=BE cents (or .6 of one cent per minute or fraction of playing tim=
e) is justified. This rate will be subject to review by the Copyright Royal=
ty Commission, as provided by section 801, in 1980 and at 10-year intervals=
 thereafter.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Accounting and Payment of Royalties; Effect =
of Default.</strong> Clause (3) of Section 115(c) provides that royalty pay=
ments are to be made on a monthly basis, in accordance with requirements th=
at the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. In order to in=
crease the protection of copyright proprietors against economic harm from c=
ompanies which might refuse or fail to pay their just obligations, compulso=
ry licensees will also be required to make a detailed cumulative annual sta=
tement of account, certified by a Certified Public Accountant.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">A source of criticism with respect to the compulsory=
 licensing provisions of the present statute has been the rather ineffectiv=
e sanctions against default by compulsory licensees. Clause (4) of section =
115(c) corrects this defect by permitting the copyright owner to serve writ=
ten notice on a defaulting licensee, and by providing for termination of th=
e compulsory license if the default is not remedied within 30 days after no=
tice is given. Termination under this clause "renders either the making or =
the distribution, or both, of all phonorecords for which the royalty had no=
t been paid, actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully=
 subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506."</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">As the program for general revision of the copyright=
 law has evolved, it has become increasingly apparent that in one major are=
a the problems are not sufficiently developed for a definitive legislative =
solution. This is the area of computer uses of copyrighted works: the use o=
f a work "in conjunction with automatic systems capable of storing, process=
ing, retrieving, or transferring information." The Commission on New Techno=
logical Uses is, among other things, now engaged in making a thorough study=
 of the emerging patterns in this field and it will, on the basis of its fi=
ndings, recommend definitive copyright provisions to deal with the situatio=
n.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Since it would be premature to change existing law o=
n computer uses at present, the purpose of section 117 is to preserve the s=
tatus quo. It is intended neither to cut off any rights that may now exist,=
 nor to create new rights that might be denied under the Act of 1909 or und=
er common law principles currently applicable.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The provision deals only with the exclusive rights o=
f a copyright owner with respect to computer uses, that is, the bundle of r=
ights specified for other types of uses in section 106 and qualified in sec=
tions 107 through 116 and 118. With respect to the copyright-ability of com=
puter programs, the ownership of copyrights in them, the term of protection=
, and the formal requirements of the remainder of the bill, the new statute=
 would apply.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 117, an action for infringement of a c=
opyrighted work by means of a computer would necessarily be a federal actio=
n brought under the new title 17. The court, in deciding the scope of exclu=
sive rights in the computer area, would first need to determine the applica=
ble law, whether State statutory or common law or the Act of 1909. Having d=
etermined what law was applicable, its decision would depend upon its inter=
pretation of what that law was on the point on the day before the effective=
 date of the new statute.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>General Background.</strong> During its cons=
ideration of revision legislation in 1975, the Senate Judiciary Committee a=
dopted an amendment offered by Senator Charles McC. Mathias. The amendment,=
 now section 118 of the Senate bill [this section], grants to public broadc=
asting a compulsory license for use of nondramatic literary and musical wor=
ks, as well as pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, subject to payment=
 of reasonable royalty fees to be set by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal est=
ablished by that bill. The Mathias amendment requires that public broadcast=
ers, at periodic intervals, file a notice with the Copyright Office contain=
ing information required by the Register of Copyrights and deposit a statem=
ent of account and the total royalty fees for the period covered by the sta=
tement. In July of each year all persons having a claim to such fees are to=
 file their claims with the Register of Copyrights. If no controversy exist=
s, the Register would distribute the royalties to the various copyright own=
ers and their agents after deducting reasonable administrative costs; contr=
oversies are to be settled by the Tribunal.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">On July 10, 1975, the House Subcommittee heard testi=
mony on the Mathias amendment from representatives of public broadcasters, =
authors, publishers, and music performing rights societies. The public broa=
dcasters pointed to Congressional concern for the development of their acti=
vities as evidenced by the Public Broadcasting Act [47 U.S.C. 390 et seq.].=
 They urged that a compulsory license was essential to assure public broadc=
asting broad access to copyrighted materials at reasonable royalties and wi=
thout administratively cumbersome and costly "clearance" problems that woul=
d impair the vitality of their operations. The opponents of the amendment a=
rgued that the nature of public broadcasting has changed significantly in t=
he past decade, to the extent that it now competes with commercial broadcas=
ting as a national entertainment and cultural medium. They asserted that th=
e performing rights society arrangements under which copyrighted music is l=
icensed for performance removed any problem in clearing music for broadcast=
ing, and that voluntary agreements could adequately resolve the copyright p=
roblems feared by public broadcasters, at less expense and burden than the =
compulsory license, for synchronization and literary rights. The authors of=
 literary works stressed that a compulsory licensing system would deny them=
 the fundamental right to control the use of their works and protect their =
reputation in a major communications medium.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>General Policy Considerations.</strong> The =
Committee is cognizant of the intent of Congress, in enacting the Public Br=
oadcasting Act on November 7, 1967 [47 U.S.C. 390 et seq.], that encouragem=
ent and support of noncommercial broadcasting is in the public interest. It=
 is also aware that public broadcasting may encounter problems not confront=
ed by commercial broadcasting enterprises, due to such factors as the speci=
al nature of programming, repeated use of programs, and, of course, <!-- PD=
FPage:107 -->limited financial resources. Thus, the Committee determined th=
at the nature of public broadcasting does warrant special treatment in cert=
ain areas. However, the Committee did not feel that the broad compulsory li=
cense provided in the Senate bill is necessary to the continued successful =
operation of public broadcasting. In addition, the Committee believes that =
the system provided in the Senate bill for the deposit of royalty fees with=
 the Copyright Office for distribution to claimants, and the resolution of =
disputes over such distribution by a statutory tribunal, can be replaced by=
 payments directly between the parties, without the intervention of governm=
ent machinery and its attendant administrative costs.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In general, the Committee amended the public broadca=
sting provisions of the Senate bill toward attainment of the objective clea=
rly stated in the Report of the Senate Judiciary Committee, namely, that co=
pyright owners and public broadcasters be encouraged to reach voluntary pri=
vate agreements.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Procedures.</strong> Not later than thirty d=
ays following the publication by the President of the notice announcing the=
 initial appointments to the Copyright Royalty Commission (specified in Cha=
pter 8 [=C2=A7801 et seq. of this title]), the Chairman of the Commission i=
s to publish notice in the Federal Register of the initiation of proceeding=
s to determine "reasonable terms and rates" for certain uses of published n=
ondramatic musical works and published pictorial, graphic and sculptural wo=
rks, during a period ending on December 31, 1982.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Copyright owners and public broadcasting entities th=
at do not reach voluntary agreement are bound by the terms and rates establ=
ished by the Commission, which are to be published in the Federal Register =
within six months of the notice of initiation of proceedings. During the pe=
riod between the effective date of the Act [Jan. 1, 1978] and the publicati=
on of the rates and terms, the Committee has preserved the status quo by pr=
oviding, in section 118(b)(4), that the Act does not afford to copyright ow=
ners or public broadcasting entities any greater or lesser rights with resp=
ect to the relevant uses of nondramatic musical works and pictorial, graphi=
c, and sculptural works than those afforded under the law in effect on Dece=
mber 31, 1977.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">License agreements that have been voluntarily negoti=
ated supersede, as between the parties to the agreement, the terms and rate=
s established by the Commission, provided that copies of the agreements are=
 properly filed with the Copyright Office within 30 days of execution. Unde=
r clause (2) of section 118(b), the agreements may be negotiated "at any ti=
me"=E2=80=94whether before, during, or after determinations by the Commissi=
on.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 118(c), the procedures for the Commiss=
ion's establishing such rates and terms are to be repeated in the last half=
 of 1982 and every five years thereafter.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Establishment of Reasonable Terms and Rates.=
</strong> In establishing reasonable terms and rates for public broadcastin=
g use of the specified works, the Commission, under clause (b)(1) of sectio=
n 118 is to consider proposals timely submitted to it, as well as "any othe=
r relevant information", including that put forward for its consideration "=
by any interested party."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee does not intend that owners of copyrig=
hted material be required to subsidize public broadcasting. It is intended =
that the Commission assure a fair return to copyright owners without unfair=
ly burdening public broadcasters. Section 118(b)(3) provides that "the Comm=
ission may consider the rates for comparable circumstances under voluntary =
license agreements." The Commission is also expected to consider both the g=
eneral public interest in encouraging the growth and development of public =
broadcasting, and the "promotion of science and the useful arts" through th=
e encouragement of musical and artistic creation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee anticipates that the "terms" establish=
ed by the Commission shall include provisions as to acceptable methods of p=
ayment of royalties by public broadcasting entities to copyright owners. Fo=
r example, where the whereabouts of the copyright owner may not be readily =
known, the terms should specify the nature of the obligation of the public =
broadcasting entity to locate the owner, or to set aside or otherwise assur=
e payment of appropriate royalties, should he or she appear and make a clai=
m. Section 118(b)(3) requires the Commission "to establish requirements by =
which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their wo=
rks." The Committee intends that these requirements shall not impose undue =
hardships on public broadcasting entities and, in the above illustration, s=
hall provide for the specific termination of any period during which the pu=
blic broadcasting entity is required to set aside payments. It is expected =
that, in some cases, especially in the area of pictorial, graphic, and scul=
ptural works, the whereabouts of the owners of copyright may not be known a=
nd they may never appear to claim payment of royalties.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Commission is also to establish record keeping r=
equirements for public broadcasting entities in order to facilitate the ide=
ntification, calculation, allocation and payment of claims and royalties.</=
p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Works Affected.</strong> Under sections 118(=
b) and (e) of the Committee's amendment, the establishment of rates and ter=
ms by the Copyright Royalty Commission pertains only to the use of publishe=
d nondramatic musical works, and published pictorial, graphic, and sculptur=
al works. As under the Senate bill; rights in plays, operas, ballet and oth=
er stage presentations, motion pictures, and other audiovisual works are no=
t affected.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 118(f) is intended to make clear that this s=
ection does not permit unauthorized use, beyond the limits of section 107, =
of individual frames from a filmstrip or any other portion of any audiovisu=
al work. Additionally, the application of this section to pictorial, graphi=
c, and sculptural works does not extend to the production of transmission p=
rograms drawn to any substantial extent from a compilation of such works.</=
p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee also concluded that the performance of=
 nondramatic literary works should not be subject to Commission determinati=
on. It was particularly concerned that a compulsory license for literary wo=
rks would result in loss of control by authors over the use of their work i=
n violation of basic principles of artistic and creative freedom. It is rec=
ognized that copyright not only provides compensation to authors, but also =
protection as to how and where their works are used. The Committee was assu=
red by representatives of authors and publishers that licensing arrangement=
s for readings from their books, poems, and other works on public broadcast=
ing programs for reasonable compensation and under reasonable safeguards fo=
r authors' rights could be worked out in private negotiation. The Committee=
 strongly urges the parties to work toward mutually acceptable licenses; to=
 facilitate their negotiations and aid in the possible establishment of cle=
arance mechanisms and rates, the Committee's amendment provides the parties=
, in section 118(e)(1), with an appropriately limited exemption from the an=
titrust laws [15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.].</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee has also provided, in paragraph (2) of=
 clause (e), that on January 3, 1980, the Register of Copyrights, after con=
sultation with the interested parties, shall submit a report to Congress on=
 the extent to which voluntary licensing arrangements have been reached wit=
h respect to public broadcast use of nondramatic literary works, and presen=
t legislative or other recommendations, if warranted.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The use of copyrighted sound recordings in education=
al television and radio programs distributed by or through public broadcast=
ing entities is governed by section 114 and is discussed in connection with=
 that section.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Activities Affected.</strong> Section 118(d)=
 specifies the activities which may be engaged in by public broadcasting en=
tities under terms and rates established by the Commission. These include t=
he performance or display of published nondramatic musical works, and of pu=
blished pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, in the course of transmis=
sions by noncommercial educational broad<!-- PDFPage:108 -->cast stations; =
and the production, reproduction, and distribution of transmission programs=
 including such works by nonprofit organizations for the purpose of such tr=
ansmissions. It is the intent of the Committee that "interconnection" activ=
ities serving as a technical adjunct to such transmissions, such as the use=
 of satellites or microwave equipment, be included within the specified act=
ivities.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Paragraph (3) of clause (d) also includes the reprod=
uction, simultaneously with transmission, of public broadcasting programs b=
y governmental bodies or nonprofit institutions, and the performance or dis=
play of the contents of the reproduction under the conditions of section 11=
0(1). However, the reproduction so made must be destroyed at the end of sev=
en days from the transmission.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">This limited provision for unauthorized simultaneous=
 or off-the-air reproduction is limited to nondramatic musical works and pi=
ctorial, graphic and sculptural works included in public broadcasting trans=
missions. It does not extend to other works included in the transmissions, =
or to the entire transmission program.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">It is the intent of the Committee that schools be pe=
rmitted to engage in off-the-air reproduction to the extent and under the c=
onditions provided in [section] 118(d)(3); however, in the event a public b=
roadcasting station or producer makes the reproduction and distributes a co=
py to the school, the station or producer will not be held liable for the s=
chool's failure to destroy the reproduction, provided it has given notice o=
f the requirement of destruction. In such a case the school itself, althoug=
h it did not engage in the act of reproduction, is deemed an infringer full=
y subject to the remedies provided in Chapter 5 of the Act [=C2=A7501 et se=
q. of this title]. The establishment of standards for adequate notice under=
 this provision should be considered by the Commission.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 118(f) makes it clear that the rights of per=
formance and other activities specified in subsection (d) do not extend to =
the unauthorized dramatization of a nondramatic musical work.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Initial Ownership.</strong> Two basic and we=
ll-established principles of copyright law are restated in section 201(a): =
that the source of copyright ownership is the author of the work, and that,=
 in the case of a "joint work," the coauthors of the work are likewise coow=
ners of the copyright. Under the definition of section 101, a work is "join=
t" if the authors collaborated with each other, or if each of the authors p=
repared his or her contribution with the knowledge and intention that it wo=
uld be merged with the contributions of other authors as "inseparable or in=
terdependent parts of a unitary whole." The touchstone here is the intentio=
n, at the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or combined =
into an integrated unit, although the parts themselves may be either "insep=
arable" (as the case of a novel or painting) or "interdependent" (as in the=
 case of a motion picture, opera, or the words and music of a song). The de=
finition of "joint work" is to be contrasted with the definition of "collec=
tive work," also in section 101, in which the elements of merger and unity =
are lacking; there the key elements are assemblage or gathering of "separat=
e and independent works *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* into a collective whole."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The definition of "joint works" has prompted some co=
ncern lest it be construed as converting the authors of previously written =
works, such as plays, novels, and music, into coauthors of a motion picture=
 in which their work is incorporated. It is true that a motion picture woul=
d normally be a joint rather than a collective work with respect to those a=
uthors who actually work on the film, although their usual status as employ=
ees for hire would keep the question of coownership from coming up. On the =
other hand, although a novelist, playwright, or songwriter may write a work=
 with the hope or expectation that it will be used in a motion picture, thi=
s is clearly a case of separate or independent authorship rather than one w=
here the basic intention behind the writing of the work was for motion pict=
ure use. In this case, the motion picture is a derivative work within the d=
efinition of that term, and section 103 makes plain that copyright in a der=
ivative work is independent of, and does not enlarge the scope of rights in=
, any preexisting material incorporated in it. There is thus no need to spe=
ll this conclusion out in the definition of "joint work."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">There is also no need for a specific statutory provi=
sion concerning the rights and duties of the coowners of a work; court-made=
 law on this point is left undisturbed. Under the bill, as under the presen=
t law, coowners of a copyright would be treated generally as tenants in com=
mon, with each coowner having an independent right to use or license the us=
e of a work, subject to a duty of accounting to the other coowners for any =
profits.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Works Made for Hire.</strong> Section 201(b)=
 of the bill adopts one of the basic principles of the present law: that in=
 the case of works made for hire the employer is considered the author of t=
he work, and is regarded as the initial owner of copyright unless there has=
 been an agreement otherwise. The subsection also requires that any agreeme=
nt under which the employee is to own rights be in writing and signed by th=
e parties.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The work-made-for-hire provisions of this bill repre=
sent a carefully balanced compromise, and as such they do not incorporate t=
he amendments proposed by screenwriters and composers for motion pictures. =
Their proposal was for the recognition of something similar to the "shop ri=
ght" doctrine of patent law: with some exceptions, the employer would acqui=
re the right to use the employee's work to the extent needed for purposes o=
f his regular business, but the employee would retain all other rights as l=
ong as he or she refrained from the authorizing of competing uses. However,=
 while this change might theoretically improve the bargaining position of s=
creenwriters and others as a group, the practical benefits that individual =
authors would receive are highly conjectural. The presumption that initial =
own<!-- PDFPage:134 -->ership rights vest in the employer for hire is well =
established in American copyright law, and to exchange that for the uncerta=
inties of the shop right doctrine would not only be of dubious value to emp=
loyers and employees alike, but might also reopen a number of other issues.=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The status of works prepared on special order or com=
mission was a major issue in the development of the definition of "works ma=
de for hire" in section 101, which has undergone extensive revision during =
the legislative process. The basic problem is how to draw a statutory line =
between those works written on special order or commission that should be c=
onsidered as "works made for hire," and those that should not. The definiti=
on now provided by the bill represents a compromise which, in effect, spell=
s out those specific categories of commissioned works that can be considere=
d "works made for hire" under certain circumstances.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Of these, one of the most important categories is th=
at of "instructional texts." This term is given its own definition in the b=
ill: "a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication with =
the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities." The concept is =
intended to include what might be loosely called "textbook material," wheth=
er or not in book form or prepared in the form of text matter. The basic ch=
aracteristic of "instructional texts" is the purpose of their preparation f=
or "use in systematic instructional activities," and they are to be disting=
uished from works prepared for use by a general readership.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Contributions to Collective Works.</strong> =
Subsection (c) of section 201 deals with the troublesome problem of ownersh=
ip of copyright in contributions to collective works, and the relationship =
between copyright ownership in a contribution and in the collective work in=
 which it appears. The first sentence establishes the basic principle that =
copyright in the individual contribution and copyright in the collective wo=
rk as a whole are separate and distinct, and that the author of the contrib=
ution is, as in every other case, the first owner of copyright in it. Under=
 the definitions in section 101, a "collective work" is a species of "compi=
lation" and, by its nature, must involve the selection, assembly, and arran=
gement of "a number of contributions." Examples of "collective works" would=
 ordinarily include periodical issues, anthologies, symposia, and collectio=
ns of the discrete writings of the same authors, but not cases, such as a c=
omposition consisting of words and music, a work published with illustratio=
ns or front matter, or three one-act plays, where relatively few separate e=
lements have been brought together. Unlike the contents of other types of "=
compilations," each of the contributions incorporated in a "collective work=
" must itself constitute a "separate and independent" work, therefore rulin=
g out compilations of information or other uncopyrightable material and wor=
ks published with editorial revisions or annotations. Moreover, as noted ab=
ove, there is a basic distinction between a "joint work," where the separat=
e elements merge into a unified whole, and a "collective work," where they =
remain unintegrated and disparate.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The bill does nothing to change the rights of the ow=
ner of copyright in a collective work under the present law. These exclusiv=
e rights extend to the elements of compilation and editing that went into t=
he collective work as a whole, as well as the contributions that were writt=
en for hire by employees of the owner of the collective work, and those cop=
yrighted contributions that have been transferred in writing to the owner b=
y their authors. However, one of the most significant aims of the bill is t=
o clarify and improve the present confused and frequently unfair legal situ=
ation with respect to rights in contributions.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The second sentence of section 201(c), in conjunctio=
n with the provisions of section 404 dealing with copyright notice, will pr=
eserve the author's copyright in a contribution even if the contribution do=
es not bear a separate notice in the author's name, and without requiring a=
ny unqualified transfer of rights to the owner of the collective work. This=
 is coupled with a presumption that, unless there has been an express trans=
fer of more, the owner of the collective work acquires, "only the privilege=
 of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particula=
r collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later coll=
ective work in the same series."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The basic presumption of section 201(c) is fully con=
sistent with present law and practice, and represents a fair balancing of e=
quities. At the same time, the last clause of the subsection, under which t=
he privilege of republishing the contribution under certain limited circums=
tances would be presumed, is an essential counterpart of the basic presumpt=
ion. Under the language of this clause a publishing company could reprint a=
 contribution from one issue in a later issue of its magazine, and could re=
print an article from a 1980 edition of an encyclopedia in a 1990 revision =
of it; the publisher could not revise the contribution itself or include it=
 in a new anthology or an entirely different magazine or other collective w=
ork.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Transfer of Ownership.</strong> The principl=
e of unlimited alienability of copyright is stated in clause (1) of section=
 201(d). Under that provision the ownership of a copyright, or of any part =
of it, may be transferred by any means of conveyance or by operation of law=
, and is to be treated as personal property upon the death of the owner. Th=
e term "transfer of copyright ownership" is defined in section 101 to cover=
 any "conveyance, alienation, or hypothecation," including assignments, mor=
tgages, and exclusive licenses, but not including nonexclusive licenses. Re=
presentatives of motion picture producers have argued that foreclosures of =
copyright mortgages should not be left to varying State laws, and that the =
statute should establish a Federal foreclosure system. However, the benefit=
s of such a system would be of very limited application, and would not just=
ify the complicated statutory and procedural requirements that would have t=
o be established.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (2) of subsection (d) contains the first expl=
icit statutory recognition of the principle of divisibility of copyright in=
 our law. This provision, which has long been sought by authors and their r=
epresentatives, and which has attracted wide support from other groups, mea=
ns that any of the exclusive rights that go to make up a copyright, includi=
ng those enumerated in section 106 and any subdivision of them, can be tran=
sferred and owned separately. The definition of "transfer of copyright owne=
rship" in section 101 makes clear that the principle of divisibility applie=
s whether or not the transfer is "limited in time or place of effect," and =
another definition in the same section provides that the term "copyright ow=
ner," with respect to any one exclusive right, refers to the owner of that =
particular right. The last sentence of section 201(d)(2) adds that the owne=
r, with respect to the particular exclusive right he or she owns, is entitl=
ed "to all of the protection and remedies accorded to the copyright owner b=
y this title." It is thus clear, for example, that a local broadcasting sta=
tion holding an exclusive license to transmit a particular work within a pa=
rticular geographic area and for a particular period of time, could sue, in=
 its own name as copyright owner, someone who infringed that particular exc=
lusive right.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (e) provides that when an individual auth=
or's ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a co=
pyright, have not previously been voluntarily transferred, no action by any=
 governmental body or other official or organization purporting to seize, e=
xpropriate, transfer, or exercise rights of ownership with respect to the c=
opyright, or any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, shall be given =
effect under this title.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The purpose of this subsection is to reaffirm the ba=
sic principle that the United States copyright of an individual author shal=
l be secured to that author, and cannot be taken away by any involuntary tr=
ansfer. It is the intent of the subsection that the author be entitled, des=
pite any purported expropriation or involuntary transfer, to continue exerc=
ising all rights under the United States statute, and that the governmental=
 <!-- PDFPage:135 -->body or organization may not enforce or exercise any r=
ights under this title in that situation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">It may sometimes be difficult to ascertain whether a=
 transfer of copyright is voluntary or is coerced by covert pressure. But s=
ubsection (e) would protect foreign authors against laws and decrees purpor=
ting to divest them of their rights under the United States copyright statu=
te, and would protect authors within the foreign country who choose to resi=
st such covert pressures.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Traditional legal actions that may involve transfer =
of ownership, such as bankruptcy proceedings and mortgage foreclosures, are=
 not within the scope of this subsection; the authors in such cases have vo=
luntarily consented to these legal processes by their overt actions=E2=80=
=94for example, by filing in bankruptcy or by hypothecating a copyright.</p=

<p class=3D"note-body">The principle restated in section 202 is a fundament=
al and important one: that copyright ownership and ownership of a material =
object in which the copyrighted work is embodied are entirely separate thin=

 under the copyright, and this includes transfer of the copy or phonorecord=
=E2=80=94the original manuscript, the photographic negative, the unique pai=

<p class=3D"note-body">As a result of the interaction of this section and t=

thors or artists are generally presumed to transfer common law literary pro=
perty rights when they sell their manuscript or work of art, unless those r=

 order for a sale of any material object to carry with it a transfer of cop=

nuary 1, 1978, otherwise than by will, is subject to termination under the =
following conditions:</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of a grant executed by one =
author, termination of the grant may be effected by that author or, if the =
author is dead, by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this subs=

 a majority of the authors who executed it; if any of such authors is dead,=
 the termination interest of any such author may be exercised as a unit by =
the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this subsection, own and are=
 entitled to exercise a total of more than one-half of that author's intere=

<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(2) Where an author is dead, his or her ter=

<p class=3D"statutory-body-2em">(A) The widow or widower owns the author's =
entire termination interest unless there are any surviving children or gran=
dchildren of the author, in which case the widow or widower owns one-half o=

e surviving children of any dead child of the author, own the author's enti=
re termination interest unless there is a widow or widower, in which case t=
he ownership of one-half of the author's interest is divided among them.</p=
>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-2em">(C) The rights of the author's children and=
 grandchildren are in all cases divided among them and exercised on a per s=
tirpes basis according to the number of such author's children represented;=
 the share of the children of a dead child in a termination interest can be=
 exercised only by the action of a majority of them.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-2em">(D) In the event that the author's widow or=
 widower, children, and grandchildren are not living, the author's executor=

<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(3) Termination of the grant may be effecte=

five years from the date of execution of the grant; or, if the grant covers=
 the right of publication of the work, the period begins at the end of thir=
ty-five years from the date of publication of the work under the grant or a=
t the end of forty years from the date of execution of the grant, whichever=
 term ends earlier.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(4) The termination shall be effected by se=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>The Problem in General.</strong> The provisi=
ons of section 203 are based on the premise that the reversionary provision=
s of the present section on copyright renewal (17 U.S.C. sec. 24 [section 2=
4 of former title 17]) should be eliminated, and that the proposed law shou=
ld substitute for them a provision safeguarding authors against unremunerat=
ive transfers. A provision of this sort is needed because of the unequal ba=
rgaining position of authors, resulting in part from the impossibility of d=
etermining a work's value until it has been exploited. Section 203 reflects=
 a practical compromise that will further the objectives of the copyright l=
aw while recognizing the problems and legitimate needs of all interests inv=
olved.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Scope of the Provision.</strong> Instead of =
being automatic, as is theoretically the case under the present renewal pro=
vision, the termination of a transfer or license under section 203 would re=
quire the serving of an advance notice within specified time limits and und=
er specified conditions. However, although affirmative action is needed to =
effect a termination, the right to take this action cannot be waived in adv=
ance or contracted away. Under section 203(a) the right of termination woul=
d apply only to transfers and licenses executed after the effective date of=
 the new statute [Jan. 1, 1978], and would have no retroactive effect.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The right of termination would be confined to inter =
vivos transfers or licenses executed by the author, and would not apply to =
transfers by the author's successors in interest or to the author's own beq=
uests. The scope of the right would extend not only to any "transfer of cop=
yright ownership," as defined in section 101, but also to nonexclusive lice=
nses. The right of termination would not apply to "works made for hire," wh=
ich is one of the principal reasons the definition of that term assumed imp=
ortance in the development of the bill.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Who Can Terminate a Grant.</strong> Two issu=
es emerged from the disputes over section 203 as to the persons empowered t=
o terminate a grant: (1) the specific classes of beneficiaries in the case =
of joint works; and (2) whether anything less than unanimous consent of all=
 those entitled to terminate should be required to make a termination effec=
tive. The bill to some extent reflects a compromise on these points, includ=
ing a recognition of the dangers of one or more beneficiaries being induced=
 to "hold out" and of unknown children or grandchildren being discovered la=
ter. The provision can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">1. In the case of a work of joint authorship, wh=
ere the grant was signed by two or more of the authors, majority action by =
those who signed the grant, or by their interests, would be required to ter=
minate it.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">2. There are three different situations in which=
 the shares of joint authors, or of a dead author's widow or widower, child=
ren, and grandchildren, must be divided under the statute: (1) The right to=
 effect a termination; (2) the ownership of the terminated rights; and (3) =
the right to make further grants of reverted rights. The respective shares =
of the authors, and of a dead author's widow or widower, children, and gran=
dchildren, would be divided in exactly the same way in each of these situat=
ions. The terms "widow," "widower," and "children" are defined in section 1=
01 in an <!-- PDFPage:137 -->effort to avoid problems and uncertainties tha=
t have arisen under the present renewal section.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">3. The principle of per stirpes representation w=
ould also be applied in exactly the same way in all three situations. Take =
for example, a case where a dead author left a widow, two living children, =
and three grandchildren by a third child who is dead. The widow will own ha=
lf of the reverted interests, the two children will each own 162/3 percent,=
 and the three grandchildren will each own a share of roughly 5=C2=BD perce=
nt. But who can exercise the right of termination? Obviously, since she own=
s 50 percent, the widow is an essential party, but suppose neither of the t=
wo surviving children is willing to join her in the termination; is it enou=
gh that she gets one of the children of the dead child to join, or can the =
dead child's interest be exercised only by the action of a majority of his =
children? Consistent with the per stirpes principle, the interest of a dead=
 child can be exercised only as a unit by majority action of his surviving =
children. Thus, even though the widow and one grandchild would own 55=C2=BD=
 percent of the reverted copyright, they would have to be joined by another=
 child or grandchild in order to effect a termination or a further transfer=
 of reverted rights. This principle also applies where, for example, two jo=
int authors executed a grant and one of them is dead; in order to effect a =
termination, the living author must be joined by a per stirpes majority of =
the dead author's beneficiaries. The notice of termination may be signed by=
 the specified owners of termination interests or by "their duly authorized=
 agents," which would include the legally appointed guardians or committees=
 of persons incompetent to sign because of age or mental disability.</p>
<br class=3D"Q04">
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>When a Grant Can be Terminated.</strong> Sec=
tion 203 draws a distinction between the date when a termination becomes ef=
fective and the earlier date when the advance notice of termination is serv=
ed. With respect to the ultimate effective date, section 203(a)(3) provides=
, as a general rule, that a grant may be terminated during the 5 years foll=
owing the expiration of a period of 35 years from the execution of the gran=
t. As an exception to this basic 35-year rule, the bill also provides that =
"if the grant covers the right of publication of the work, the period begin=
s at the end of 35 years from the date of publication of the work under the=
 grant or at the end of 40 years from the date of execution of the grant, w=
hichever term ends earlier." This alternative method of computation is inte=
nded to cover cases where years elapse between the signing of a publication=
 contract and the eventual publication of the work.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The effective date of termination, which must be sta=
ted in the advance notice, is required to fall within the 5 years following=
 the end of the applicable 35- or 40-year period, but the advance notice it=
self must be served earlier. Under section 203(a)(4)(A), the notice must be=
 served "not less than two or more than ten years" before the effective dat=
e stated in it.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">As an example of how these time-limit requirements w=
ould operate in practice, we suggest two typical contract situations:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Case 1: Contract for theatrical production signed on=
 September 2, 1987. Termination of grant can be made to take effect between=
 September 2, 2022 (35 years from execution) and September 1, 2027 (end of =
5 year termination period). Assuming that the author decides to terminate o=
n September 1, 2022 (the earliest possible date) the advance notice must be=
 filed between September 1, 2012, and September 1, 2020.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Case 2: Contract for book publication executed on Ap=
ril 10, 1980; book finally published on August 23, 1987. Since contract cov=
ers the right of publication, the 5-year termination period would begin on =
April 10, 2020 (40 years from execution) rather than April 10, 2015 (35 yea=
rs from execution) or August 23, 2022 (35 years from publication). Assuming=
 that the author decides to make the termination effective on January 1, 20=
24, the advance notice would have to be served between January 1, 2014, and=
 January 1, 2022.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Effect of Termination.</strong> Section 203(=
b) makes clear that, unless effectively terminated within the applicable 5-=
year period, all rights covered by an existing grant will continue unchange=
d, and that rights under other Federal, State, or foreign laws are unaffect=
ed. However, assuming that a copyright transfer or license is terminated un=
der section 203, who are bound by the termination and how are they affected=
?</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the bill, termination means that ownership of =
the rights covered by the terminated grant reverts to everyone who owns ter=
mination interests on the date the notice of termination was served, whethe=
r they joined in signing the notice or not. In other words, if a person cou=
ld have signed the notice, that person is bound by the action of the majori=
ty who did; the termination of the grant will be effective as to that perso=
n, and a proportionate share of the reverted rights automatically vests in =
that person. Ownership is divided proportionately on the same per stirpes b=
asis as that provided for the right to effect termination under section 203=
(a) and, since the reverted rights vest on the date notice is served, the h=
eirs of a dead beneficiary would inherit his or her share.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under clause (3) of subsection (b), majority action =
is required to make a further grant of reverted rights. A problem here, of =
course, is that years may have passed between the time the reverted rights =
vested and the time the new owners want to make a further transfer; people =
may have died and children may have been born in the interim. To deal with =
this problem, the bill looks back to the date of vesting; out of the group =
in whom rights vested on that date, it requires the further transfer or lic=
ense to be signed by "the same number and proportion of the owners" (though=
 not necessarily the same individuals) as were then required to terminate t=
he grant under subsection (a). If some of those in whom the rights original=
ly vested have died, their "legal representatives, legatees, or heirs at la=
w" may represent them for this purpose and, as in the case of the terminati=
on itself, any one of the minority who does not join in the further grant i=
s nevertheless bound by it.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">An important limitation on the rights of a copyright=
 owner under a terminated grant is specified in section 203(b)(1). This cla=
use provides that, notwithstanding a termination, a derivative work prepare=
d earlier may "continue to be utilized" under the conditions of the termina=
ted grant; the clause adds, however, that this privilege is not broad enoug=
h to permit the preparation of other derivative works. In other words, a fi=
lm made from a play could continue to be licensed for performance after the=
 motion picture contract had been terminated but any remake rights covered =
by the contract would be cut off. For this purpose, a motion picture would =
be considered as a "derivative work" with respect to every "preexisting wor=
k" incorporated in it, whether the preexisting work was created independent=
ly or was prepared expressly for the motion picture.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 203 would not prevent the parties to a trans=
fer or license from voluntarily agreeing at any time to terminate an existi=
ng grant and negotiating a new one, thereby causing another 35-year period =
to start running. However, the bill seeks to avoid the situation that has a=
risen under the present renewal provision, in which third parties have boug=
ht up contingent future interests as a form of speculation. Section 203(b)(=
4) would make a further grant of rights that revert under a terminated gran=
t valid "only if it is made after the effective date of the termination." A=
n exception, in the nature of a right of "first refusal," would permit the =
original grantee or a successor of such grantee to negotiate a new agreemen=
t with the persons effecting the termination at any time after the notice o=
f termination has been served.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Nothing contained in this section or elsewhere in th=
is legislation is intended to extend the duration of any license, transfer =
or assignment made for a period of less than thirty-five years. If, for exa=
mple, an agreement provides an earlier termination date or lesser duration,=
 or if it allows the author the right of cancelling or ter<!-- PDFPage:138 =
-->minating the agreement under certain circumstances, the duration is gove=
rned by the agreement. Likewise, nothing in this section or legislation is =
intended to change the existing state of the law of contracts concerning th=
e circumstances in which an author may cancel or terminate a license, trans=
fer, or assignment.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 203(b)(6) provides that, unless and until te=
rmination is effected under this section, the grant, "if it does not provid=
e otherwise," continues for the term of copyright. This section means that,=
 if the agreement does not contain provisions specifying its term or durati=
on, and the author has not terminated the agreement under this section, the=
 agreement continues for the term of the copyright, subject to any right of=
 termination under circumstances which may be specified therein. If, howeve=
r, an agreement does contain provisions governing its duration=E2=80=94for =
example, a term of fifty years=E2=80=94and the author has not exercised his=
 or her right of termination under the statute, the agreement will continue=
 according to its terms=E2=80=94in this example, for only fifty years. The =
quoted language is not to be construed as requiring agreements to reserve t=
he right of termination.</p>

counterpart of sections 28 and 29 of the present statute [sections 28 and 2=
9 of former title 17]. Under subsection (a), a transfer of copyright owners=

"or such owner's duly authorized agent." Subsection (b) makes clear that a =
notarial or consular acknowledgment is not essential to the validity of any=
 transfer, whether executed in the United States or abroad. However, the su=
bsection would liberalize the conditions under which certificates of acknow=
ledgment of documents executed abroad are to be accorded prima facie weight=
, and would give the same weight to domestic acknowledgments under appropri=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">The recording and priority provisions of section 205=
 are intended to clear up a number of uncertainties arising from sections 3=
0 and 31 of the present law [sections 30 and 31 of former title 17] and to =
make them more effective and practical in operation. Any "document pertaini=
ng to a copyright" may be recorded under subsection (a) if it "bears that a=
ctual signature of the person who executed it," or if it is appropriately c=
ertified as a true copy. However, subsection (c) makes clear that the recor=
ded document will give constructive notice of its contents only if two cond=
itions are met: (1) the document or attached material specifically identifi=
es the work to which it pertains so that a reasonable search under the titl=
e or registration number would reveal it, and (2) registration has been mad=
e for the work. Moreover, even though the Register of Copyrights may be com=
pelled to accept for recordation documents that on their face appear self-s=
erving or colorable, the Register should take care that their nature is not=
 concealed from the public in the Copyright Office's indexing and search re=
ports.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The provisions of subsection (d), requiring recordat=
ion of transfers as a prerequisite to the institution of an infringement su=
it, represent a desirable change in the law. The one- and three-month grace=
 periods provided in subsection (e) are a reasonable compromise between tho=
se who want a longer hiatus and those who argue that any grace period makes=
 it impossible for a bona fide transferee to rely on the record at any part=
icular time.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under subsection (f) of section 205, a nonexclusive =
license in writing and signed, whether recorded or not, would be valid agai=
nst a later transfer, and would also prevail as against a prior unrecorded =
transfer if taken in good faith and without notice. Objections were raised =
by motion picture producers, particularly to the provision allowing unrecor=
ded nonexclusive licenses to prevail over subsequent transfers, on the grou=
nd that a nonexclusive license can have drastic effects on the value of a c=
opyright. On the other hand, the impracticalities and burdens that would ac=
company any requirement of recordation of nonexclusive licenses outweigh th=
e limited advantages of a statutory recordation system for them.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Single Federal System.</strong> Section 301,=
 one of the bedrock provisions of the bill, would accomplish a fundamental =
and significant change in the present law. Instead of a dual system of "com=
mon law copyright" for unpublished works and statutory copyright for publis=
hed works, which has been the system in effect in the United States since t=
he first copyright statute in 1790, the bill adopts a single system of Fede=
ral statutory copyright from creation. Under section 301 a work would obtai=
n statutory protection as soon as it is "created" or, as that term is defin=
ed in section 101 when it is "fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first =
time." Common law copyright protection for works coming within the scope of=
 the statute would be abrogated, and the concept of publication would lose =
its all-embracing importance as a dividing line between common law and stat=
utory protection and between both of these forms of legal protection and th=
e public domain.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">By substituting a single Federal system for the pres=
ent anachronistic, uncertain, impractical, and highly complicated dual syst=
em, the bill would greatly improve the operation of the copyright law and w=
ould be much more effective in carrying out the basic constitutional aims o=
f uniformity and the promotion of writing and scholarship. The main argumen=
ts in favor of a single Federal system can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">1. One of the fundamental purposes behind the co=
pyright clause of the Constitution, as shown in Madison's comments in The F=
ederalist, was to promote national uniformity and to avoid the practical di=
fficulties of determining and enforcing an author's rights under the differ=
ing laws and in the separate courts of the various States. Today when the m=
ethods for dissemination of an author's work are incomparably broader and f=
aster than they were in 1789, national uniformity in copyright protection i=
s even more essential than it was then to carry out the constitutional inte=
nt.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">2. "Publication," perhaps the most important sin=
gle concept under the present law, also represents its most serious defect.=
 Although at one time when works were disseminated almost exclusively throu=
gh printed copies, "publication" could serve as a practical dividing line b=
etween common law and statutory protection, this is no longer true. With th=
e development of the 20th-century communications revolution, the concept of=
 publication has become increasingly artificial and obscure. To cope with t=
he legal consequences of an established concept that has lost much of its m=
eaning and justification, the courts have given "publication" a number of d=
iverse interpretations, some of them radically different. Not unexpectedly,=
 the results in individual cases have become unpredictable and often unfair=
. A single Federal system would help to clear up this chaotic situation.</p=
>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">3. Enactment of section 301 would also implement=
 the "limited times" provision of the Constitution [Const. Art. I, =C2=A78,=
 cl. 8], which has become distorted under the traditional concept of "publi=
cation." Common law protection in "unpublished" works is now perpetual, no =
matter how widely they may be disseminated by means other than "publication=
"; the bill would place a time limit on the duration of exclusive rights in=
 them. The provision would also aid scholarship and the dissemination of hi=
storical materials by making unpublished, undisseminated manuscripts availa=
ble for publication after a reasonable period.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">4. Adoption of a uniform national copyright syst=
em would greatly improve international dealings in copyrighted material. No=
 other country has anything like our present dual system. In an era when co=
pyrighted works can be disseminated instantaneously to every country on the=
 globe, the need for effective international copyright relations, and the c=
oncomitant need for national uniformity, assume ever greater importance.</p=
>
<!-- PDFPage:141 --><p class=3D"note-body">Under section 301, the statute w=
ould apply to all works created after its effective date [Jan 1, 1978], whe=
ther or not they are ever published or disseminated. With respect to works =
created before the effective date of the statute [Jan. 1, 1978] and still u=
nder common law protection, section 303 of the statute would provide protec=
tion from that date on, and would guarantee a minimum period of statutory c=
opyright.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Preemption of State Law.</strong> The intent=
ion of section 301 is to preempt and abolish any rights under the common la=
w or statutes of a State that are equivalent to copyright and that extend t=
o works coming within the scope of the Federal copyright law. The declarati=
on of this principle in section 301 is intended to be stated in the cleares=
t and most unequivocal language possible, so as to foreclose any conceivabl=
e misinterpretation of its unqualified intention that Congress shall act pr=
eemptively, and to avoid the development of any vague borderline areas betw=
een State and Federal protection.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 301(a) all "legal or equitable rights =
that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope=
 of copyright as specified by section 106" are governed exclusively by the =
Federal copyright statute if the works involved are "works of authorship th=
at are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject=
 matter of copyright as specified by sections 102 and 103." All correspondi=
ng State laws, whether common law or statutory, are preempted and abrogated=
. Regardless of when the work was created and whether it is published or un=
published, disseminated or undisseminated, in the public domain or copyrigh=
ted under the Federal statute, the States cannot offer it protection equiva=
lent to copyright. Section 1338 of title 28, United States Code, also makes=
 clear that any action involving rights under the Federal copyright law wou=
ld come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts. The preemp=
tive effect of section 301 is limited to State laws; as stated expressly in=
 subsection (d) of section 301, there is no intention to deal with the ques=
tion of whether Congress can or should offer the equivalent of copyright pr=
otection under some constitutional provision other than the patent-copyrigh=
t clause of article 1, section 8 [Const. Art. I, =C2=A78, cl. 8].</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">As long as a work fits within one of the general sub=
ject matter categories of sections 102 and 103, the bill prevents the State=
s from protecting it even if it fails to achieve Federal statutory copyrigh=
t because it is too minimal or lacking in originality to qualify, or becaus=
e it has fallen into the public domain. On the other hand section 301(b) ex=
plicitly preserves common law copyright protection for one important class =
of works: works that have not been "fixed in any tangible medium of express=
ion." Examples would include choreography that has never been filmed or not=
ated, an extemporaneous speech, "original works of authorship" communicated=
 solely through conversations or live broadcasts, and a dramatic sketch or =
musical composition improvised or developed from memory and without being r=
ecorded or written down. As mentioned above in connection with section 102,=
 unfixed works are not included in the specified "subject matter of copyrig=
ht." They are therefore not affected by the preemption of section 301, and =
would continue to be subject to protection under State statute or common la=
w until fixed in tangible form.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The preemption of rights under State law is complete=
 with respect to any work coming within the scope of the bill, even though =
the scope of exclusive rights given the work under the bill is narrower tha=
n the scope of common law rights in the work might have been.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Representatives of printers, while not opposed to th=
e principle of section 301, expressed concern about its potential impact on=
 protection of preliminary advertising copy and layouts prepared by printer=
s. They argued that this material is frequently "pirated" by competitors, a=
nd that it would be a substantial burden if, in order to obtain full protec=
tion, the printer would have to make registrations and bear the expense and=
 bother of suing in Federal rather than State courts. On the other hand, th=
ese practical problems are essentially procedural rather than substantive, =
and the proposal for a special exemption to preserve common law rights equi=
valent to copyright in unpublished advertising material cannot be justified=
. Moreover, subsection (b), discussed below, will preserve other legal grou=
nds on which the printers can protect themselves against "pirates" under St=
ate laws.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In a general way subsection (b) of section 301 repre=
sents the obverse of subsection (a). It sets out, in broad terms and withou=
t necessarily being exhaustive, some of the principal areas of protection t=
hat preemption would not prevent the States from protecting. Its purpose is=
 to make clear, consistent with the 1964 Supreme Court decisions in <i>Sear=
s, Roebuck &amp; Co., v. Stiffel Co</i>., 376 U.S. 225 [84 S.Ct. 784, 11 L.=
Ed.2d 661, rehearing denied 84 S.Ct. 1131, 376 U.S. 973, 12 L.Ed.2d 87], an=
d <i>Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc</i>., 376 U.S. 234 [84 S.Ct. 7=
79, 11 L.Ed.2d 669, rehearing denied 84 S.Ct. 1162, 377 U.S. 913, 12 L.Ed.2=
d 183], that preemption does not extend to causes of action, or subject mat=
ter outside the scope of the revised Federal copyright statute.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The numbered clauses of subsection (b) list three ge=
neral areas left unaffected by the preemption: (1) subject matter that does=
 not come within the subject matter of copyright; (2) causes of action aris=
ing under State law before the effective date of the statute [Jan. 1, 1978]=
; and (3) violations of rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclus=
ive rights under copyright.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The examples in clause (3), while not exhaustive, ar=
e intended to illustrate rights and remedies that are different in nature f=
rom the rights comprised in a copyright and that may continue to be protect=
ed under State common law or statute. The evolving common law rights of "pr=
ivacy," "publicity," and trade secrets, and the general laws of defamation =
and fraud, would remain unaffected as long as the causes of action contain =
elements, such as an invasion of personal rights or a breach of trust or co=
nfidentiality, that are different in kind from copyright infringement. Noth=
ing in the bill derogates from the rights of parties to contract with each =
other and to sue for breaches of contract; however, to the extent that the =
unfair competition concept known as "interference with contract relations" =
is merely the equivalent of copyright protection, it would be preempted.</p=
>
<p class=3D"note-body">The last example listed in clause (3)=E2=80=94"decep=
tive trade practices such as passing off and false representation"=E2=80=94=
represents an effort to distinguish between those causes of action known as=
 "unfair competition" that the copyright statute is not intended to preempt=
 and those that it is. Section 301 is not intended to preempt common law pr=
otection in cases involving activities such as false labeling, fraudulent r=
epresentation, and passing off even where the subject matter involved comes=
 within the scope of the copyright statute.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">"Misappropriation" is not necessarily synonymous wit=
h copyright infringement, and thus a cause of action labeled as "misappropr=
iation" is not preempted if it is fact based neither on a right within the =
general scope of copyright as specified by section 106 nor on a right equiv=
alent thereto. For example, state law should have the flexibility to afford=
 a remedy (under traditional principles of equity) against a consistent pat=
tern of unauthorized appropriation by a competitor of the facts (i.e., not =
the literary expression) constituting "hot" news, whether in the traditiona=
l mold of <i>International News Service v. Associated Press</i>, 248 U.S. 2=
15 (1918) [39 S.Ct. 68, 63 L.Ed. 211], or in the newer form of data updates=
 from scientific, business, or financial data bases. Likewise, a person hav=
ing no trust or other relationship with the proprietor of a computerized da=
ta base should not be immunized from sanctions against electronically or cr=
yptographically breaching the proprietor's security arrangements and access=
ing the proprietor's data. The unauthorized data access which should be rem=
ediable might also be achieved by the intentional interception of data tran=
smissions by wire, microwave or laser transmissions, or by the common unint=
entional means of "crossed" telephone lines occasioned by errors in switchi=
ng.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:142 --><p class=3D"note-body">The proprietor of data displayed=
 on the cathode ray tube of a computer terminal should be afforded protecti=
on against unauthorized printouts by third parties (with or without imprope=

y not be copyrighted because they are not fixed in a tangible medium of exp=
ression (i.e., the data are not displayed for a period or not more than tra=
nsitory duration).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Nothing contained in section 301 precludes the owner=

<p class=3D"note-body">A unique and difficult problem is presented with res=
pect to the status of sound recordings fixed before February 12, 1972, the =
effective date of the amendment bringing recordings fixed after that date u=
nder Federal copyright protection. In its testimony during the 1975 hearing=
s, the Department of Justice pointed out that, under section 301 as then wr=
itten:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">This language could be read as abrogating the an=
ti-piracy laws now existing in 29 states relating to pre-February 15, 1972,=
 sound recordings on the grounds that these statutes proscribe activities v=
iolating rights equivalent to&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the exclusive rights wit=
hin the general scope of copyright.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Certainly such a r=
esult cannot have been intended for it would likely effect the immediate re=
surgence of piracy of pre-February 15, 1972, sound recordings.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-block">The Department recommended that section 301(b)=
 be amended to exclude sound recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972 fr=
om the effect of the preemption.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Senate adopted this suggestion when it passed S.=
 22. The result of the Senate amendment would be to leave pre-1972 sound re=
cordings as entitled to perpetual protection under State law, while post-19=
72 recordings would eventually fall into the public domain as provided in t=
he bill.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee recognizes that, under recent court de=
cisions, pre-1972 recordings are protected by State statute or common law, =
and that should not all be thrown into the public domain instantly upon the=
 coming into effect of the new law. However, it cannot agree that they shou=
ld in effect be accorded perpetual protection, as under the Senate amendmen=
t, and it has therefore revised clause (4) to establish a future date for t=
he pre-emption to take effect. The date chosen is February 15, 2047 which i=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>In General.</strong> The debate over how lon=
g a copyright should last is as old as the oldest copyright statute and wil=
l doubtless continue as long as there is a copyright law. With certain exce=
ptions, there appears to be strong support for the principle, as embodied i=
n the bill, of a copyright term consisting of the life of the author and 50=
 years after his death. In particular, the authors and their representative=
s stressed that the adoption of a life-plus-50 term was by far their most i=
mportant legislative goal in copyright law revision. The Register of Copyri=
ghts now regards a life-plus-50 term as the foundation of the entire bill.<=
/p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the present law statutory copyright protection=
 begins on the date of publication (or on the date of registration in unpub=
lished form) and continues for 28 years from that date; it may be renewed f=
or a second 28 years, making a total potential term of 56 years in all case=
s. [Under Public Laws 87=E2=80=93668, 89=E2=80=93142, 90=E2=80=93141, 90=E2=
=80=93416, 91=E2=80=93147, 91=E2=80=93555, 92=E2=80=93170, 92=E2=80=93566, =
and 93=E2=80=93573, copyrights that were subsisting in their renewal term o=
n September 19, 1962, and that were scheduled to expire before Dec. 31, 197=
6, have been extended to that later date, in anticipation that general revi=
sion legislation extending their terms still further will be enacted by the=
n.] The principal elements of this system=E2=80=94a definite number of year=
s, computed from either publication or registration, with a renewal feature=
=E2=80=94have been a part of the U.S. copyright law since the first statute=
 in 1790. The arguments for changing this system to one based on the life o=
f the author can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">1. The present 56-year term is not long enough t=
o insure an author and his dependents the fair economic benefits from his w=
orks. Life expectancy has increased substantially, and more and more author=
s are seeing their works fall into the public domain during their lifetimes=
, forcing later works to compete with their own early works in which copyri=
ght has expired.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">2. The tremendous growth in communications media=
 has substantially lengthened the commercial life of a great many works. A =
short term is particularly discriminatory against serious works of music, l=
iterature, and art, whose value may not be recognized until after many year=
s.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">3. Although limitations on the term of copyright=
 are obviously necessary, too short a term harms the author without giving =
any substantial benefit to the public. The public frequently pays the same =
for works in the public domain as it does for copyrighted works, and the on=
ly result is a commercial windfall to certain users at the author's expense=
. In some cases the lack of copyright protection actually restrains dissemi=
nation of the work, since publishers and other users cannot risk investing =
in the work unless assured of exclusive rights.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">4. A system based on the life of the author woul=
d go a long way toward clearing up the confusion and uncertainty involved i=
n the vague concept of "publication," and would provide a much simpler, cle=
arer method for computing the term. The death of the author is a definite, =
determinable event, and it would be the only date that a potential user wou=
ld have to worry about. All of a particular author's works, including succe=
ssive revisions of them, would fall into the public domain at the same time=
, thus avoiding the present problems of determining a multitude of publicat=
ion dates and of distinguishing "old" and "new" matter in later editions. T=
he bill answers the problems of determining when relatively obscure authors=
 died, by establishing a registry of death dates and a system of presumptio=
ns.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">5. One of the worst features of the present copy=
right law is the provision for renewal of copyright. A substantial burden a=
nd expense, this unclear and highly technical requirement results in incalc=
ulable amounts of unproductive work. In a number of cases it is the cause o=
f inadvertent and unjust loss of copyright. Under a life-plus-50 system the=
 renewal device would be inappropriate and unnecessary.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">6. Under the preemption provisions of section 30=
1 and the single Federal system they would establish, authors will be givin=
g up perpetual, unlimited exclusive common law rights in their unpublished =
works, including works that have been widely disseminated by means other th=
an publication. A statutory term of life-plus-50 years is no more than a fa=
ir recompense for the loss of these perpetual rights.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">7. A very large majority of the world's countrie=
s have adopted a copyright term of the life of the author and 50 years afte=
r the author's death. Since American authors are frequently protected longe=
r in foreign countries than in the United States, the disparity in the dura=
tion of copyright has provoked considerable resentment and some proposals f=
or retaliatory legislation. Copyrighted works move across national borders =
faster and more easily than virtually any other economic commodity, and wit=
h the techniques now in common use this movement has in many cases become i=
nstantaneous and effortless. The need to conform the duration of U.S. copyr=
ight to that prevalent throughout the rest of the world is increasingly pre=
ssing in order to provide certainty and simplicity in international busines=
s dealings. Even more important, a change in the basis of our copyright ter=
m would place the United States in the forefront of the international copyr=
ight community. Without this change, the possibility of future United State=
s adherence to the Berne Copyright Union would evaporate, but with it would=
 come a great and immediate improvement in our copyright relations. All of =
these benefits would accrue directly to American and foreign authors alike.=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The need for a longer total term of copyright has be=
en conclusively demonstrated. It is true that a major reason for the striki=
ng statistical increase in life expectancy since 1909 is the reduction in i=
nfant mortality, but this does not mean that the increase can be discounted=
. Although not nearly as great as the total increase in life expectancy, th=
ere has been a marked increase in longevity, and with medical discoveries a=
nd <!-- PDFPage:144 -->health programs for the elderly this trend shows eve=
ry indication of continuing. If life expectancy in 1909, which was in the n=
eighborhood of 56 years, offered a rough guide to the length of copyright p=
rotection, then life expectancy in the 1970's which is well over 70 years, =
should offer a similar guide; the Register's 1961 Report included statistic=
s indicating that something between 70 and 76 years was then the average eq=
uivalent of life-plus-50 years. A copyright should extend beyond the author=
's lifetime, and judged by this standard the present term of 56 years is to=
o short.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The arguments as to the benefits of uniformity with =
foreign laws, and the advantages of international comity that would result =
from adoption of a life-plus-50 term, are also highly significant. The syst=
em has worked well in other countries, and on the whole it would appear to =
make computation of terms considerably simpler and easier. The registry of =
death dates and the system of presumptions established in section 302 would=
 solve most of the problems in determining when an individual author died.<=
/p>
<p class=3D"note-body">No country in the world has provisions on the durati=
on of copyright like ours. Virtually every other copyright law in the world=
 bases the term of protection for works by natural persons on the life of t=
he author, and a substantial majority of these accord protection for 50 yea=
rs after the author's death. This term is required for adherence to the Ber=
ne Convention. It is worth noting that the 1965 revision of the copyright l=
aw of the Federal Republic of Germany adopted a term of life plus 70 years.=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">A point that has concerned some educational groups a=
rose from the possibility that, since a large majority (now about 85 percen=
t) of all copyrighted works are not renewed, a life-plus-50 year term would=
 tie up a substantial body of material that is probably of no commercial in=
terest but that would be more readily available for scholarly use if free o=
f copyright restrictions. A statistical study of renewal registrations made=
 by the Copyright Office in 1966 supports the generalization that most mate=
rial which is considered to be of continuing or potential commercial value =
is renewed. Of the remainder, a certain proportion is of practically no val=
ue to anyone, but there are a large number of unrenewed works that have sch=
olarly value to historians, archivists, and specialists in a variety of fie=
lds. This consideration lay behind the proposals for retaining the renewal =
device or for limiting the term for unpublished or unregistered works.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">It is true that today's ephemera represent tomorrow'=
s social history, and that works of scholarly value, which are now falling =
into the public domain after 28 years, would be protected much longer under=
 the bill. Balanced against this are the burdens and expenses of renewals, =
the near impossibility of distinguishing between types of works in fixing a=
 statutory term, and the extremely strong case in favor of a life-plus-50 s=
ystem. Moreover, it is important to realize that the bill would not restrai=
n scholars from using any work as source material or from making "fair use"=
 of it; the restrictions would extend only to the unauthorized reproduction=
 or distribution of copies of the work, its public performance, or some oth=
er use that would actually infringe the copyright owner's exclusive rights.=
 The advantages of a basic term of copyright enduring for the life of the a=
uthor and for 50 years after the author's death outweigh any possible disad=
vantages.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Basic Copyright Term.</strong> Under subsect=
ion (a) of section 302, a work "created" on or after the effective date of =
the revised statute [Jan. 1, 1978] would be protected by statutory copyrigh=
t "from its creation" and, with exceptions to be noted below, "endures for =
a term consisting of the life of the author and 50 years after the author's=
 death."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under this provision, as a general rule, the life-pl=
us-50 term would apply equally to unpublished works, to works published dur=
ing the author's lifetime, and to works published posthumously.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The definition of "created" in section 101, which wi=
ll be discussed in more detail in connection with section 302(c) below, mak=
es clear that "creation" for this purpose means the first time the work is =
fixed in a copy or phonorecord; up to that point the work is not "created,"=
 and is subject to common law protection, even though it may exist in someo=
ne's mind and may have been communicated to others in unfixed form.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Joint Works.</strong> Since by definition a =
"joint work" has two or more authors, a statute basing the term of copyrigh=
t on the life of the author must provide a special method of computing the =
term of "joint works." Under the system in effect in many foreign countries=
, the term of copyright is measured from the death of the last survivor of =
a group of joint authors, no matter how many there are. The bill adopts thi=
s system as the simplest and fairest of the alternatives for dealing with t=
he problem.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Wor=
ks Made for Hire.</strong> Computing the term from the author's death also =
requires special provisions to deal with cases where the authorship is not =
revealed or where the "author" is not an individual. Section 302(c) therefo=
re provides a special term for anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and wor=
ks made for hire: 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whi=
chever is shorter. The definitions in section 101 make the status of anonym=
ous and pseudonymous works depend on what is revealed on the copies or phon=
orecords of a work; a work is "anonymous" if "no natural person is identifi=
ed as author," and is "pseudonymous" if "the author is identified under a f=
ictitious name."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 302(c) provides that the 75- and 100-year te=
rms for an anonymous or pseudonymous work can be converted to the ordinary =
life-plus-50 term if "the identity of one or more authors *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* i=
s revealed" in special records maintained for this purpose in the Copyright=
 Office. The term in such cases would be "based on the life of the author o=
r authors whose identity has been revealed." Instead of forcing a user to s=
earch through countless Copyright Office records to determine if an author'=
s identity has been revealed, the bill sets up a special registry for the p=
urpose, with requirements concerning the filing of identifying statements t=
hat parallel those of the following subsection (d) with respect to statemen=
ts of the date of an author's death.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The alternative terms established in section 302(c)=
=E2=80=9475 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever ex=
pires first=E2=80=94are necessary to set a time limit on protection of unpu=
blished material. For example, copyright in a work created in 1978 and publ=
ished in 1988 would expire in 2063 (75 years from publication). A question =
arises as to when the copyright should expire if the work is never publishe=
d. Both the Constitution and the underlying purposes of the bill require th=
e establishment of an alternative term for unpublished work and the only pr=
acticable basis for this alternative is "creation." Under the bill a work c=
reated in 1980 but not published until after 2005 (or never published) woul=
d fall into the public domain in 2080 (100 years after creation).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The definition in section 101 provides that "creatio=
n" takes place when a work "is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first=
 time." Although the concept of "creation" is inherently lacking in precisi=
on, its adoption in the bill would, for example, enable a scholar to use an=
 unpublished manuscript written anonymously, pseudonymously, or for hire, i=
f he determines on the basis of internal or external evidence that the manu=
script is at least 100 years old. In the case of works written over a perio=
d of time or in successive revised versions, the definition provides that t=
he portion of the work "that has been fixed at any particular time constitu=
tes the work as of that time," and that, "where the work has been prepared =
in different versions, each version constitutes a separate work." Thus, a s=
cholar or other user, in attempting to determine whether a particular work =
is in the public domain, needs to look no further than the particular versi=
on he wishes to use.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Although "publication" would no longer play the cent=
ral role assigned to it under the present law, the concept would still have=
 substantial significance under <!-- PDFPage:145 -->provisions throughout t=
he bill, including those on Federal preemption and duration. Under the defi=
nition in section 101, a work is "published" if one or more copies or phono=
records embodying it are distributed to the public=E2=80=94that is, general=
ly to persons under no explicit or implicit restrictions with respect to di=
sclosure of its contents=E2=80=94without regard to the manner in which the =
copies or phonorecords changed hands. The definition clears up the question=
 of whether the sale of phonorecords constitutes publication, and it also m=
akes plain that any form or dissemination in which a material object does n=
ot change hands=E2=80=94performances or displays on television, for example=
=E2=80=94is not a publication no matter how many people are exposed to the =
work. On the other hand, the definition also makes clear that, when copies =
or phonorecords are offered to a group of wholesalers, broadcasters, motion=
 picture theaters, etc., publication takes place if the purpose is "further=
 distribution, public performance, or public display."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Although the periods of 75 or 100 years for anonymou=
s and pseudonymous works and works made for hire seem to be longer than the=
 equivalent term provided by foreign laws and the Berne Conventions, this d=
ifference is more apparent than real. In general, the terms in these specia=
l cases approximate, on the average, the term of the life of the author plu=
s 50 years established for other works. The 100-year maximum term for unpub=
lished works, although much more limited than the perpetual term now availa=
ble under common law in the United States and under statute in some foreign=
 countries, is sufficient to guard against unjustified invasions of privacy=
 and to fulfill our obligations under the Universal Copyright Convention.</=
p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Records and Presumption as to Author's Death=
.</strong> Subsections (d) and (e) of section 302 together furnish an answe=
r to the practical problems of how to discover the death dates of obscure o=
r unknown authors. Subsection (d) provides a procedure for recording statem=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Theoretically, at least, the legal impact of section=
 303 would be far reaching. Under it, every "original work of authorship" f=
ixed in tangible form that is in existence would be given statutory copyrig=
ht protection as long as the work is not in the public domain in this count=
ry. The vast majority of these works consist of private material that no on=
e is interested in protecting or infringing, but section 303 would still ha=
ve practical effects for a prodigious body of material already in existence=
.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Looked at another way, however, section 303 would ha=
ve a genuinely restrictive effect. Its basic purpose is to substitute statu=
tory for common law copyright for everything now protected at common law, a=
nd to substitute reasonable time limits for the perpetual protection now av=
ailable. In general, the substituted time limits are those applicable to wo=
rks created after the effective date of the law [Jan. 1, 1978]; for example=
, an unpublished work written in 1945 whose author dies in 1980 would be pr=
otected under the statute from the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978] through 20=
30 (50 years after the author's death).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">A special problem under this provision is what to do=
 with works whose ordinary statutory terms will have expired or will be nea=
ring expiration on the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978]. The committee believe=
s that a provision taking away subsisting common law rights and substitutin=
g statutory rights for a reasonable period is fully in harmony with the con=
stitutional requirements of due process, but it is necessary to fix a "reas=
onable period" for this purpose. Section 303 provides that under no circums=
tances would copyright protection expire before December 31, 2002, and also=
 attempts to encourage publication by providing 25 years more protection (t=
hrough 2027) if the work were published before the end of 2002.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">The arguments in favor of lengthening the duration o=
f copyright apply to subsisting as well as future copyrights. The bill's ba=
sic approach is to increase the present 56-year term to 75 years in the cas=
e of copyrights subsisting in both their first and their renewal terms.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Copyrights in Their First Term.</strong> Sub=
section (a) of section 304 reenacts and preserves the renewal provision, no=
w in Section 24 of the statute [section 24 of former title 17], for all of =
the works presently in their first 28-year term. A great many of the presen=
t expectancies in these cases are the subject of existing contracts, and it=
 would be unfair and immensely confusing to cut off or alter these interest=
s. Renewal registration will be required during the 28th year of the copyri=
ght but the length of the renewal term will be increased from 28 to 47 year=
s.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Although the bill preserves the language of the pres=
ent renewal provision without any change in substance, the Committee intend=
s that the reference to a "posthumous work" in this section has the meaning=
 given to it in <i>Bartok v. Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Inc</i>., 523 F.2d 941 (2=
d Cir. 1975)=E2=80=94one as to which no copyright assignment or other contr=
act for exploitation of the work has occurred during an author's lifetime, =
rather than one which is simply first published after the author's death.</=
p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Copyrights in Their Renewal Term.</strong> R=
enewed copyrights that are subsisting in their second term at any time duri=
ng the period between December 31, 1976, and December 31, 1977, inclusive, =
would be extended under section 304(b) to run for a total of 75 years. This=
 provision would add another 19 years to the duration of any renewed copyri=
ght whose second term started during the 28 years immediately preceding the=
 effective date of the act (January 1, 1978). In addition, it would extend =
by varying lesser amounts the duration of renewal copyrights already extend=
ed under Public Laws 87=E2=80=93668, 89=E2=80=93142, 90=E2=80=93141, 90=E2=
=80=93416, 91=E2=80=93147, 91=E2=80=93555, 92=E2=80=93170, 92=E2=80=93566, =
and 93=E2=80=93573, all of which would otherwise expire on December 31, 197=
6. The subsection would also extend the duration of renewal copyrights whos=
e second 28-year term is scheduled to expire during 1977. In none of these =
cases, however, would the total terms of copyright for the work be longer t=
han 75 years.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (b) also covers the special situation of =
a subsisting first-term copyright that becomes eligible for renewal registr=
ation during the year before the act comes into effect. If a renewal regist=
ration is not made before the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978], the case is go=
verned by the provisions of section 304(a) [subsec. (a) of this section]. I=
f a renewal registration is made during the year before the new law takes e=
ffect, however, the copyright would be treated as if it were already subsis=
ting in its second term and would be extended to the full period of 75 year=
s without the need for further renewal.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Termination of Grants Covering Extended Term=
.</strong> An issue underlying the 19-year extension of renewal terms under=
 both subsections (a) and (b) of section 304 [subsecs. (a) and (b) of this =
section] is whether, in a case where their rights have already been transfe=
rred, the author or the dependents of the author should be given a chance t=
o benefit from the extended term. The arguments for granting rights of term=
ination are even more persuasive under section 304 than they are under sect=
ion 203; the extended term represents a completely new property right, and =
there are strong reasons for giving the author, who is the fundamental bene=
ficiary of copyright under the Constitution, an opportunity to share in it.=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (c) of section 304 is a close but not exa=
ct counterpart of section 203. In the case of either a first-term or renewa=
l copyright already subsisting when the new statute becomes effective [Jan.=
 1, 1978], any grant of rights covering the renewal copyright in the work, =
executed before the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978], may be terminated under =
conditions and limitations similar to those provided in section 203. Except=
 for transfers and licenses covering renewal copyrights already extended un=
der Public Laws 87=E2=80=93668, 89=E2=80=93142, 90=E2=80=93141, 90=E2=80=93=
416, 91=E2=80=93147, 91=E2=80=93555, 92=E2=80=93170, 92=E2=80=93566, and 93=
=E2=80=93573, which would become subject to termination immediately upon th=
e coming into effect of the revised law, the 5-year period during which ter=
mination could be made effective would start 56 years after copyright was o=
riginally secured.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The bill distinguishes between the persons who can t=
erminate a grant under section 203 and those entitled to terminate a grant =
covering an extended term under section 304. Instead of being limited to tr=
ansfers and licenses executed by the author, the right of termination under=
 section 304(c) also extends to grants executed by those beneficiaries of t=
he author who can claim renewal under the present law: his or her widow or =
widower, children, executors, or next of kin.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">There is good reason for this difference. Under sect=
ion 203, an author's widow or widower and children are given rights of term=
ination if the author is dead, but these rights apply only to grants by the=
 author, and any effort by a widow, widower, or child to transfer contingen=
t future interests under a termination would be ineffective. In contrast, u=
nder the present renewal provisions, any statutory beneficiary of the autho=
r can make a valid transfer or license of future renewal rights, which is c=
ompletely binding if the author is dead and the person who executed the gra=
nt turns out to be the proper renewal claimant. Because of this, a great ma=
ny contingent transfers of future renewal rights have been obtained from wi=
dows, widowers, children, and next of kin, and a substantial number of thes=
e will be binding. After the present 28-year renewal period has ended, a st=
atutory beneficiary who has signed a disadvantageous grant of this sort sho=
uld have the opportunity to reclaim the extended term.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">As explained above in connection with section 203, t=
he bill adopts the principle that, where a transfer or license by the autho=
r is involved, termination may be effected by a per stirpes majority of tho=
se entitled to terminate, and this principle also applies to the ownership =
of rights under a termination and to the making of further grants of revert=
ed rights. In general, this principle has also been adopted with respect to=
 the termination of rights under an extended renewal copyright in section 3=
04, but with several differences made <!-- PDFPage:149 -->necessary by the =
differences between the legal status of transfers and licenses made after t=
he effective date of the new law [Jan. 1, 1978] (governed by section 203) a=
nd that of grants of renewal rights made earlier and governed by section 30=
4(c). The following are the most important distinctions between the termina=
tion rights under the two sections:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em"><i>1. Joint Authorship</i>.=E2=80=94Under sectio=
n 304, a grant of renewal rights executed by joint authors during the first=
 term of copyright would be effective only as to those who were living at t=
he time of renewal; where any of them are dead, their statutory beneficiari=
es are entitled to claim the renewal independently as a new estate. It woul=
d therefore be inappropriate to impose a requirement of majority action wit=
h respect to transfers executed by two or more joint authors.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em"><i>2. Grants Not Executed by Author</i>.=E2=80=
=94Section 304(c) adopts the majority principle underlying the amendments o=
f section 203 [section 203 of this title] with respect to the termination r=
ights of a dead author's widow or widower and children. There is much less =
reason, as a matter of policy, to apply this principle in the case of trans=
fers and licenses of renewal rights executed under the present law by the a=
uthor's widow, widower, children, executors, or next of kin, and the practi=
cal arguments against doing so are conclusive. It is not clear how the shar=
es of a class of renewal beneficiaries are to be divided under the existing=
 law, and greater difficulties would be presented if any attempt were made =
to apply the majority principle to further beneficiaries in cases where one=
 or more of the renewal beneficiaries are dead. Therefore, where the grant =
was executed by a person or persons other than the author, termination can =
be effected only by the unanimous action of the survivors of those who exec=
uted it.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em"><i>3. Further Grants</i>.=E2=80=94The reason aga=
inst adopting a principle of majority action with respect to the right to t=
erminate grants by joint authors and grants not executed by the author appl=
y equally with respect to the right to make further grants under section 30=
4(c). The requirement for majority action in clause (6)(C) is therefore con=
fined to cases where the rights under a grant by the author have reverted t=
o his or her widow or widower, or children, or both. Where the extended ter=
m reverts to joint authors or to a class of renewal beneficiaries who have =
joined in executing a grant, their rights would be governed by the general =
rules of tenancy in common; each coowner would have an independent right to=
 sell his share, or to use or license the work subject to an accounting.</p=
>
<p class=3D"note-body">Nothing contained in this section or elsewhere in th=
is legislation is intended to extend the duration of any license, transfer,=
 or assignment made for a period of less than fifty-six years. If, for exam=
ple, an agreement provides an earlier termination date or lesser duration, =
or if it allows the author the right of cancelling or terminating the agree=
ment under certain circumstances, the duration is governed by the agreement=
. Likewise, nothing in this section or legislation is intended to change th=
e existing state of the law of contracts concerning the circumstances in wh=
ich an author may terminate a license, transfer or assignment.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 304(c)(6)(E) provides that, unless and until=
 termination is effected under this section, the grant, "if it does not pro=
vide otherwise," continues for the term of copyright. This section means th=
at, if the agreement does not contain provisions specifying its term or dur=
ation, and the author has not terminated the agreement under this section, =
the agreement continues for the term of the copyright, subject to any right=
 of termination under circumstances which may be specified therein. If, how=
ever, an agreement does contain provisions governing its duration=E2=80=94f=
or example, a term of sixty years=E2=80=94and the author has not exercised =
his or her right of termination under the statute, the agreement will conti=
nue according to its terms=E2=80=94in this example, for only sixty years. T=
he quoted language is not to be construed as requiring agreements to reserv=
e the right of termination.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 305, which has its counterpart in the =
laws of most foreign countries, the term of copyright protection for a work=
 extends through December 31 of the year in which the term would otherwise =
have expired. This will make the duration of copyright much easier to compu=
te, since it will be enough to determine the year, rather than the exact da=
te, of the event from which the term is based.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 305 applies only to "terms of copyright prov=
ided by sections 302 through 304," which are the sections dealing with dura=
tion of copyright. It therefore has no effect on the other time periods spe=
cified in the bill; and, since they do not involve "terms of copyright," th=
e periods provided in section 304(c) with respect to termination of grants =
are not affected by section 305.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The terminal date section would change the duration =
of subsisting copyrights under section 304 by extending the total terms of =
protection under subsections (a) and (b) to the end of the 75th year from t=
he date copyright was secured. A copyright subsisting in its first term on =
the effective date of the act [Jan. 1, 1978] would run through December 31 =
of the 28th year and would then expire unless renewed. Since all copyright =
terms under the bill expire on December 31, and since section 304(a) requir=
es that renewal be made "within one year prior to the expiration of the ori=
ginal term of copyright," the period for renewal registration in all cases =
will run from December 31 through December 31.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">A special situation arises with respect to subsistin=
g copyrights whose first 28-year term expires during the first year after t=
he act comes into effect. As already explained in connection with section 3=
04(b), if a renewal registration for a copyright of this sort is made befor=
e the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978], the total term is extended to 75 years=
 without the need for a further renewal registration. But, if renewal has n=
ot yet been made when the act becomes effective [Jan. 1, 1978], the period =
for renewal registration may in some cases be extended. If, as the bill pro=
vides, the act becomes effective on January 1, 1978, a copyright that was o=
riginally secured on September 1, 1950, could have been renewed by virtue o=
f the present statute between September 1, 1977, and December 31, 1977; if =
not, it can still be renewed under section 304(a) of the new act between Ja=
nuary 1, 1978, and December 31, 1978.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">A requirement that the public be given formal notice=
 of every work in which copyright is claimed was a part of the first U.S. c=
opyright statute enacted in 1790, and since 1802 our copyright laws have al=
ways provided that the published copies of copyrighted works must bear a <!=
-- PDFPage:152 -->specified notice as a condition of protection. Under the =
present law the copyright notice serves four principal functions:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(1) It has the effect of placing in the public d=
omain a substantial body of published material that no one is interested in=
 copyrighting;</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(2) It informs the public as to whether a partic=
ular work is copyrighted;</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(3) It identifies the copyright owner; and</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(4) It shows the date of publication.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Ranged against these values of a notice requirement =
are its burdens and unfairness to copyright owners. One of the strongest ar=
guments for revision of the present statute has been the need to avoid the =
arbitrary and unjust forfeitures now resulting from unintentional or relati=
vely unimportant omissions or errors in the copyright notice. It has been c=
ontended that the disadvantages of the notice requirement outweigh its valu=
es and that it should therefore be eliminated or substantially liberalized.=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The fundamental principle underlying the notice prov=
isions of the bill is that the copyright notice has real values which shoul=
d be preserved, and that this should be done by inducing use of notice with=
out causing outright forfeiture for errors or omissions. Subject to certain=
 safeguards for innocent infringers, protection would not be lost by the co=
mplete omission of copyright notice from large numbers of copies or from a =
whole edition, if registration for the work is made before or within 5 year=
s after publication. Errors in the name or date in the notice could be corr=
ected without forfeiture of copyright.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Sections 401 and 402 set out the basic notice requir=
ements of the bill, the former dealing with "copies from which the work can=
 be visually perceived," and the latter covering "phonorecords" of a "sound=
 recording." The notice requirements established by these parallel provisio=
ns apply only when copies or phonorecords of the work are "publicly distrib=
uted." No copyright notice would be required in connection with the public =
display of a copy by any means, including projectors, television, or cathod=
e ray tubes connected with information storage and retrieval systems, or in=
 connection with the public performance of a work by means of copies or pho=
norecords, whether in the presence of an audience or through television, ra=
dio, computer transmission, or any other process.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">It should be noted that, under the definition of "pu=
blication" in section 101, there would no longer be any basis for holding, =
as a few court decisions have done in the past, that the public display of =
a work of art under some conditions (e.g., without restriction against its =
reproduction) would constitute publication of the work. And, as indicated a=
bove, the public display of a work of art would not require that a copyrigh=
t notice be placed on the copy displayed.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsections (a) of both section 401 and section 402 =
require that a notice be used whenever the work "is published in the United=
 States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner." The phrase "or e=
lsewhere," which does not appear in the present law, makes the notice requi=
rements applicable to copies or phonorecords distributed to the public anyw=
here in the world, regardless of where and when the work was first publishe=
d. The values of notice are fully applicable to foreign editions of works c=
opyrighted in the United States, especially with the increased flow of inte=
llectual materials across national boundaries, and the gains in the use of =
notice on editions published abroad under the Universal Copyright Conventio=
n should not be wiped out. The consequences of omissions or mistakes with r=
espect to the notice are far less serious under the bill than under the pre=
sent law, and section 405(a) makes doubly clear that a copyright owner may =
guard himself against errors or omissions by others if he makes use of the =
prescribed notice an express condition of his publishing licenses.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (b) of section 401, which sets out the fo=
rm of notice to appear on visually-perceptible copies, retains the basic el=
ements of the notice under the present law: the word "Copyright", the abbre=
viation "Copr.", or the symbol "=C2=A9"; the year of first publication; and=
 the name of the copyright owner. The year of publication, which is still s=
ignificant in computing the term and determining the status of a work, is r=
equired for all categories of copyrightable works. Clause (2) of subsection=
 (b) makes clear that, in the case of a derivative work or compilation, it =
is not necessary to list the dates of publication of all preexisting materi=
al incorporated in the work; however, as noted below in connection with sec=
tion 409, the application for registration covering a compilation or deriva=
tive work must identify "any preexisting work or works that it is based on =
or incorporates." Clause (3) establishes that a recognizable abbreviation o=
r a generally known alternative designation may be used instead of the full=
 name of the copyright owner.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">By providing simply that the notice "shall be affixe=
d to the copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of=
 the claim of copyright," subsection (c) follows the flexible approach of t=
he Universal Copyright Convention. The further provision empowering the Reg=
ister of Copyrights to set forth in regulations a list of examples of "spec=
ific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of =
works that will satisfy this requirement" will offer substantial guidance a=
nd avoid a good deal of uncertainty. A notice placed or affixed in accordan=
ce with the regulations would clearly meet the requirements but, since the =
Register's specifications are not to "be considered exhaustive," a notice p=
laced or affixed in some other way might also comply with the law if it wer=
e found to "give reasonable notice" of the copyright claim.</p>

<p class=3D"note-body">A special notice requirement, applicable only to the=
 subject matter of sound recordings, is established by section 402. Since t=
he bill protects sound recordings as separate works, independent of protect=
ion for any literary or musical works embodied in them, there would be a li=
kelihood of confusion if the same notice requirements applied to sound reco=
rdings and to the works they incorporate. Like the present law, therefore, =
section 402 thus sets forth requirements for a notice to appear on the "pho=
norecords" of "sound recordings" that are different from the notice require=
ments established by section 401 for the "copies" of all other types of cop=
yrightable works. Since "phonorecords" are not "copies," there is no need t=
o place a section 401 notice on "phonorecords" to protect the literary or m=
usical works embodied in the records.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In general, the form of the notice specified by sect=
ion 402(b) consists of the symbol "(P)"; the year of first publication of t=
he sound recording; and the name of the copyright owner or an admissible va=
riant. Where the record producer's name appears on the record label, album,=
 sleeve, jacket, or other container, it will be considered a part of the no=
tice if no other name appears in conjunction with it. Under subsection (c),=
 the notice for a copyrighted sound recording may be affixed to the surface=
, label, or container of the phonorecord "in such manner and location as to=
 give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">There are at least three reasons for prescribing use=
 of the symbol "(P)" rather than "=C2=A9" in the notice to appear on phonor=
ecords of sound recordings. Aside from the need to avoid confusion between =
claims to copyright in the sound recording and in the musical or literary w=
ork embodied in it, there is also a necessity for distinguishing between co=
pyright claims in the sound recording and in the printed text or art work a=
ppearing on the record label, album cover, liner notes, et cetera. The symb=
ol "=C2=A9" has also been adopted as the international symbol for the prote=
ction of sound recordings by the "Phonograms Convention" (the Convention fo=
r the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplicatio=
n of Their Phonograms, done at Geneva October 29, 1971), to which the Unite=
d States is a party.</p>

<p class=3D"note-body">Section 403 is aimed at a publishing practice that, =
while technically justified under the present law, has been the object of c=
onsiderable criticism. In cases where a Government work is published or rep=
ublished commercially, it has frequently been the practice to add some "new=
 matter" in the form of an introduction, editing, illustrations, etc., and =
to include a general copyright notice in the name of the commercial publish=
er. This in no way suggests to the public that the bulk of the work is unco=
pyrightable and therefore free for use.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">To make the notice meaningful rather than misleading=
, section 403 requires that, when the copies or phonorecords consist "prepo=
nderantly of one or more works of the United States Government," the copyri=
ght notice (if any) identify those parts of the work in which copyright is =
claimed. A failure to meet this requirement would be treated as an omission=

<p class=3D"note-body">In conjunction with the provisions of section 201(c)=
, section 404 deals with a troublesome problem under the present law: the n=
otice requirements applicable to contributions published in periodicals and=
 other collective works. The basic approach of the section is threefold:</p=
>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(1) To permit but not require a separate contrib=
ution to bear its own notice;</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(2) To make a single notice, covering the collec=
tive work as a whole, sufficient to satisfy the notice requirement for the =
separate contributions it contains, even if they have been previously publi=
shed or their ownership is different; and</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(3) To protect the interests of an innocent infr=
inger of copyright in a contribution that does not bear its own notice, who=
 has dealt in good faith with the person named in the notice covering the c=
ollective work as a whole.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">As a general rule, under this section, the rights in=
 an individual contribution to a collective work would not be affected by t=
he lack of a separate copyright notice, as long as the collective work as a=
 whole bears a notice. One exception to this rule would apply to "advertise=
ments inserted on behalf of persons other than the owner of copyright in th=
e collective work." Collective works, notably newspapers and magazines, are=
 major advertising media, and it is common for the same advertisement to be=
 published in a number of different periodicals. The general copyright noti=
ce in a particular issue would not ordinarily protect the advertisements in=
serted in it, and relatively little advertising matter today is published w=
ith a separate copyright notice. The exception in section 404(a), under whi=
ch separate notices would be required for most advertisements published in =
collective works, would impose no undue burdens on copyright owners and is =
justified by the special circumstances.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 404(b) a separate contribution that do=
es not bear its own notice, and that is published in a collective work with=
 a general notice containing the name of someone other than the copyright o=
wner of the contribution, is treated as if it has been published with the w=
rong name in the notice. The case is governed by section 406(a), which mean=
s that an innocent infringer who in good faith took a license from the pers=
on named in the general notice would be shielded from liability to some ext=
ent.</p>

<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Effect of Omission on Copyright Protection.<=
/strong> The provisions of section 405(a) make clear that the notice requir=
ements of sections 401, 402, and 403 are not absolute and that, unlike the =
law now in effect, the outright omission of a copyright notice does not aut=
omatically forfeit protection and throw the work into the public domain. Th=
is not only represents a major change in the theoretical framework of Ameri=
can copyright law, but it also seems certain to have immediate practical co=
nsequences in a great many individual cases. Under the proposed law a work =
published without any copyright notice will still be subject to statutory p=
rotection for at least 5 years, whether the omission was partial or total, =
unintentional or deliberate.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the general scheme of the bill, statutory copy=
right protection is secured automatically when a work is created, and is no=
t lost when the work is published, even if the copyright notice is omitted =
entirely. Subsection (a) of section 405 provides that omission of notice, w=
hether intentional or unintentional, does not invalidate the copyright if e=
ither of two conditions is met:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(1) if "no more than a relatively small number" =
of copies or phonorecords have been publicly distributed without notice; or=
</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(2) if registration for the work has already bee=
n made, or is made within 5 years after the publication without notice, and=
 a reasonable effort is made to add notice to copies or phonorecords public=
ly distributed in the United States after the omission is discovered.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Thus, if notice is omitted from more than a "relativ=
ely small number" of copies or phonorecords, copyright is not lost immediat=
ely, but the work will go into the public domain if no effort is made to co=
rrect the error or if the work is not registered within 5 years.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 405(a) takes a middle-ground approach in an =
effort to encourage use of a copyright notice without causing unfair and un=
justifiable forfeitures on technical grounds. Clause (1) provides that, as =
long as the omission is from "no more than a relatively small number of cop=
ies or phonorecords," there is no effect upon the copyright owner's rights =
except in the case of an innocent infringement covered by section 405(b); t=
here is no need for registration or for efforts to correct the error if thi=
s clause is applicable. The phrase "relatively small number" is intended to=
 be less restrictive than the phrase "a particular copy or copies" now in s=
ection 21 of the present law [section 21 of former title 21].</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under clause (2) of subsection (a), the first condit=
ion for curing an omission from a larger number of copies is that registrat=
ion be made before the end of 5 years from the defective publication. This =
registration may have been made before the omission took place or before th=
e work had been published in any form and, since the reasons for the omissi=
on have no bearing on the validity of copyright, there would be no need for=
 the application to refer to them. Some time limit for registration is esse=
ntial and the 5-year period is reasonable and consistent with the period pr=
ovided in section 410(c).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The second condition established by clause (2) is th=
at the copyright owner make a "reasonable effort," after discovering his er=
ror, to add the notice to copies or phonorecords distributed thereafter. Th=
is condition is specifically limited to copies or phonorecords publicly dis=
tributed in the United States, since it would be burdensome and impractical=
 to require an American copyright owner to police the activities of foreign=
 licensees in this situation.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The basic notice requirements set forth in sections =
401(a) and 402(a) are limited to cases where a work is published "by author=
ity of the copyright owner" and, in prescribing the effect of omission of n=
otice, section 405(a) refers only to omission "from copies or phonorecords =
publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner." The intention be=
hind this language is that, where the copyright owner authorized publicatio=
n of the work, the notice requirements would not be met if copies or phonor=
ecords are publicly distributed without a notice, even if he expected a not=
ice to be used. However, if the copyright owner authorized publication only=
 on the express condition that all copies or phonorecords bear a prescribed=
 notice, the provisions of section 401 or 402 and of section 405 would not =
apply since the publication itself would not be authorized. This principle =
is stated directly in section 405(a)(3).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Effect of Omission on Innocent Infringers.</=
strong> In addition to the possibility that copyright protection will be fo=
rfeited under section 405(a)(2) if the notice is omitted, a second major in=
ducement to use of the notice is found in subsection (b) of section 405. Th=
at provision, which limits the rights of a copyright owner against innocent=
 infringers under certain circumstances, would be applicable whether the no=
tice has been omitted from a large number or from a "relatively small numbe=
r" of copies. The general postulates underlying the provision are that a pe=
rson acting in good faith and with no reason to think otherwise should ordi=
narily be able to assume that a work is in the public domain if there is no=
 notice on an authorized copy or phonorecord and that, if he relies on this=
 assumption, he should be shielded from unreasonable liability.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 405(b) an innocent infringer who acts =
"in reliance upon an authorized copy or phonorecord from which the copyrigh=
t notice has been omitted", and who proves that he was misled by the omissi=
on, is shielded from liability for actual or statutory damages with respect=
 to "any infringing acts committed before receiving actual notice" of regis=
tration. Thus, where the infringement is completed before actual notice has=
 been served=E2=80=94as would be the usual case with respect to relatively =
minor infringements by teachers, librarians, journalists, and the like=E2=
=80=94liability, if any, would be limited to the profits the infringer real=
ized from the act of infringement. On the other hand, where the infringing =
enterprise is one running over a period of time, the copyright owner would =
be able to seek an injunction against continuation of the infringement, and=
 to obtain full monetary recovery for all infringing acts committed after h=
e had served notice of registration. Persons who undertake major enterprise=
s of this sort should check the Copyright Office registration records befor=
e starting, even where copies have been published without notice.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The purpose of the second sentence of subsection (b)=
 is to give the courts broad discretion to balance the equities within the =
framework of section 405 [this section]. Where an infringer made profits fr=
om infringing acts committed innocently before receiving notice from the co=
pyright owner, the court may allow or withhold their recovery in light of t=
he circumstances. The court may enjoin an infringement or may permit its co=
ntinuation on condition that the copyright owner be paid a reasonable licen=
se fee.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Removal of Notice by Others.</strong> Subsec=
tion (c) of section 405 involves the situation arising when, following <!--=
 PDFPage:156 -->an authorized publication with notice, someone further down=
 the chain of commerce removes, destroys, or obliterates the notice. The co=
urts dealing with this problem under the present law, especially in connect=
ion with copyright notices on the selvage of textile fabrics, have generall=
y upheld the validity of a notice that was securely attached to the copies =
when they left the control of the copyright owner, even though removal of t=
he notice at some later stage was likely. This conclusion is incorporated i=
n subsection (c).</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">In addition to cases where notice has been omitted e=
ntirely, it is common under the present law for a copyright notice to be fa=
tally defective because the name or date has been omitted or wrongly stated=
. Section 406 is intended to avoid technical forfeitures in these cases, wh=
ile at the same time inducing use of the correct name and date and protecti=
ng users who rely on erroneous information.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Error in Name.</strong> Section 406(a) begin=
s with a statement that the use of the wrong name in the notice will not af=
fect the validity or ownership of the copyright, and then deals with situat=
ions where someone acting innocently and in good faith infringes a copyrigh=
t by relying on a purported transfer or license from the person erroneously=
 named in the notice. In such a case the innocent infringer is given a comp=
lete defense unless a search of the Copyright Office records would have sho=
wn that the owner was someone other than the person named in the notice. Us=
e of the wrong name in the notice is no defense if, at the time infringemen=
t was begun, registration had been made in the name of the true owner, or i=
f "a document executed by the person named in the notice and showing the ow=
nership of the copyright had been recorded."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The situation dealt with in section 406(a) presuppos=
es a contractual relation between the copyright owner and the person named =
in the notice. The copies or phonorecords bearing the defective notice have=
 been "distributed by authority of the copyright owner" and, unless the pub=
lication can be considered unauthorized because of breach of an express con=
dition in the contract or other reasons, the owner must be presumed to have=
 acquiesced in the use of the wrong name. If the person named in the notice=
 grants a license for use of the work in good faith or under a misapprehens=
ion, that person should not be liable as a copyright infringer, but the las=
t sentence of section 406(a) would make the person named in the notice liab=
le to account to the copyright owner for "all receipts, from transfers or l=
icenses purportedly made under the copyright" by that person.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Error in Date.</strong> The familiar problem=
s of antedated and postdated notices are dealt with in subsection (b) of se=
ction 406. In the case of an antedated notice, where the year in the notice=
 is earlier than the year of first <!-- PDFPage:157 -->publication, the bil=
l adopts the established judicial principle that any statutory term measure=
d from the year of publication will be computed from the year given in the =
notice. This provision would apply not only to the copyright terms of anony=
mous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire under section 302(c=
), but also to the presumptive periods set forth in section 302(e).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">As for postdated notices, subsection (b) provides th=
at, where the year in the notice is more than one year later than the year =
of first publication the case is treated as if the notice had been omitted =
and is governed by section 405. Notices postdated by one year are quite com=
mon on works published near the end of a year, and it would be unnecessaril=
y strict to equate cases of that sort with works published without notice o=
f any sort.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Omission of Name or Date.</strong> Section 4=
06(c) provides that, if the copies or phonorecords "contain no name or no d=
ate that could reasonably be considered a part of the notice," the result i=
s the same as if the notice had been omitted entirely, and section 405 cont=
rols. Unlike the present law, the bill contains no provision requiring the =
elements of the copyright notice to "accompany" each other, and under secti=
on 406(c) a name or date that could reasonably be read with the other eleme=
nts may satisfy the requirements even if somewhat separated from them. Dire=
ct contiguity or juxtaposition of the elements is no longer necessary; but =
if the elements are too widely separated for their relation to be apparent,=
 or if uncertainty is created by the presence of other names or dates, the =
case would have to be treated as if the name or date, and hence the notice =
itself had been omitted altogether.</p>

<p class=3D"note-body">The provisions of sections 407 through 411 of the bi=
ll mark another departure from the present law. Under the 1909 statute, dep=
osit of copies for the collections of the Library of Congress and deposit o=
f copies for purposes of copyright registration have been treated as the sa=
me thing. The bill's basic approach is to regard deposit and registration a=
s separate though closely related: deposit of copies or phonorecords for th=
e Library of Congress is mandatory, but exceptions can be made for material=
 the Library neither needs nor wants; copyright registration is not general=
ly mandatory, but is a condition of certain remedies for copyright infringe=
ment. Deposit for the Library of Congress can be, and in the bulk of cases =
undoubtedly will be, combined with copyright registration.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The basic requirement of the deposit provision, sect=
ion 407, is that within 3 months after a work has been published with notic=
e of copyright in the United States, the "owner of copyright or of the excl=
usive right of publication" must deposit two copies or phonorecords of the =
work in the Copyright Office. The Register of Copyrights is authorized to e=
xempt any category of material from the deposit requirements. Where the cat=
egory is not exempted and deposit is not made, the Register may demand it; =
failure to comply would be penalized by a fine.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the present law deposits for the Library of Co=
ngress must be combined with copyright registration, and failure to comply =
with a formal demand for deposit and registration results in complete loss =
of copyright. Under section 407 of the bill, the deposit requirements can b=
e satisfied without ever making registration, and subsection (a) makes clea=
r that deposit "is not a condition of copyright protection." A realistic fi=
ne, coupled with the increased inducements for voluntary registration and d=
eposit under other sections of the bill, seems likely to produce a more eff=
ective deposit system than the present one. The bill's approach will also a=
void the danger that, under a divisible copyright, one copyright owner's ri=
ghts could be destroyed by another owner's failure to deposit.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Although the basic deposit requirements are limited =
to works "published with notice of copyright in the United States," they wo=
uld become applicable as soon as a work first published abroad is published=
 in this country through the distribution of copies or phonorecords that ar=
e either imported or are part of an American edition. With respect to all t=
ypes or works other than sound recordings, the basic obligation is to depos=
it "two complete copies of the best edition"; the term "best edition," as d=
efined in section 101, makes clear that the Library of Congress is entitled=
 to receive copies of phonorecords from the edition it believes best suits =
its needs regardless of the quantity or quality of other U.S. editions that=
 may also have been published before the time of deposit. Once the deposit =
requirements for a particular work have been satisfied under section 407, h=
owever, the Library cannot claim deposit of future editions unless they rep=
resent newly copyrightable works under section 103.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The deposit requirement for sound recordings include=
s "two complete phonorecords of the best edition" and any other visually-pe=
rceptible material published with the phonorecords. The reference here is t=
o the text or pictorial matter appearing on record sleeves and album covers=
 or embodied in separate leaflets or booklets included in a sleeve, album, =
or other container. The required deposit in the case of a sound recording w=
ould extend to the entire "package" and not just to the disk, tape, or othe=
r phonorecord included as part of it.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Deposits under section 407, although made in the Cop=
yright Office, are "for the use or disposition of the Library of Congress."=
 Thus, the fundamental criteria governing regulations issued under section =
407(c), which allows exemptions from the deposit requirements for certain c=
ategories of works, would be the needs and wants of the Library. The purpos=
e of this provision is to make the deposit requirements as flexible as poss=
ible, so that there will be no obligation to make deposits where it serves =
no purpose, so that only one copy or phonorecord may be deposited where two=
 are not needed, and so that reasonable adjustments can be made to meet pra=
ctical needs in special cases. The regulations, in establishing special cat=
egories for these purposes, would necessarily balance the value of the copi=
es or phonorecords to the collections of the Library of Congress against th=
e burdens and costs to the copyright owner of providing them.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee adopted an amendment to subsection (c)=
 of section 407, aimed at meeting the concerns expressed by representatives=
 of various artists' groups concerning the deposit of expensive art works a=
nd graphics published in limited editions. Under the present law, optional =
deposit of photographs is permitted for various classes of works, but not f=
or fine prints, and this has resulted in many artists choosing to forfeit c=
opyright protection rather than bear the expense of depositing "two copies =
of the best edition." To avoid this unfair result, the last sentence of sub=
section (c) would require the Register to issue regulations under which suc=
h works would either be exempted entirely from the mandatory deposit or wou=
ld be subject to an appropriate alternative form of deposit.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:159 --><p class=3D"note-body">If, within three months after th=
e Register of Copyrights has made a formal demand for deposit in accordance=
 with section 407(d), the person on whom the demand was made has not compli=
ed, that person becomes liable to a fine up to $250 for each work, plus the=
 "total retail price of the copies or phonorecords demanded." If no retail =
price has been fixed, clause (2) of subsection (d) establishes the addition=
al amount as "the reasonable cost to the Library of Congress of acquiring t=
hem." Thus, where the copies or phonorecords are not available for sale thr=
ough normal trade channels=E2=80=94as would be true of many motion picture =
films, video tapes, and computer tapes, for example=E2=80=94the item of cos=
t to be included in the fine would be equal to the basic expense of duplica=
ting the copies or phonorecords plus a reasonable amount representing what =
it would have cost the Library to obtain them under its normal acquisitions=
 procedures, if they had been available.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">There have been cases under the present law in which=
 the mandatory deposit provisions have been deliberately and repeatedly ign=
ored, presumably on the assumption that the Library is unlikely to enforce =
them. In addition to the penalties provided in the current bill, the last c=
lause of subsection (d) would add a fine of $2,500 for willful or repeated =
failure or refusal to deposit upon demand.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee also amended section 407 [this section=
] by adding a new subsection (e), with conforming amendments of sections 40=
7(a) and 408(b). These amendments are intended to provide a basis for the L=
ibrary of Congress to acquire, as a part of the copyright deposit system, c=
opies or recordings of non-syndicated radio and television programs, withou=
t imposing any hardships on broadcasters. Under subsection (e) the Library =
is authorized to tape programs off the air in all cases and may "demand" th=
at the broadcaster supply the Library with a copy or phonorecord of a parti=
cular program. However, this "demand" authority is extremely limited: (1) T=
he broadcaster is not required to retain any recording of a program after i=
t has been transmitted unless a demand has already been received; (2) the d=
emand would cover only a particular program; "blanket" demands would not be=
 permitted; (3) the broadcaster would have the option of supplying the dema=
nd by gift, by loan for purposes of reproduction, or by sale at cost; and (=
4) the penalty for willful failure or refusal to comply with a demand is li=
mited to the cost of reproducing and supplying the copy or phonorecord in q=
uestion.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Permissive Registration.</strong> Under sect=
ion 408(a), registration of a claim to copyright in any work whether publis=
hed or unpublished, can be made voluntarily by "the owner of copyright or o=
f any exclusive right in the work" at any time during the copyright term. T=
he claim may be registered in the Copyright Office by depositing the copies=
, phonorecords, or other material specified by subsection (b) and (c), toge=
ther with an application and fee. Except where, under section 405(a), regis=
tration is made to preserve a copyright that would otherwise be invalidated=
 because of omission of the notice, registration is not a condition of copy=
right protection.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Deposit for Purpose of Copyright Registratio=
n.</strong> In general, and subject to various exceptions, the material to =
be deposited for copyright registration consists of one complete copy or ph=
onorecord of an unpublished work, and two complete copies or phonorecords o=
f the best edition in the case of a published work. Section 408(b) provides=
 special deposit requirements in the case of a work first published abroad =
("one complete copy or phonorecord as so published") and in the case of a c=
ontribution to a collective work ("one complete copy or phonorecord of the =
best edition of the collective work"). As a general rule the deposit of mor=
e than a tear sheet or similar fraction of a collective work is needed to i=
dentify the contribution properly and to show the form in which it was publ=
ished. Where appropriate as in the case of collective works such as multivo=
lume encyclopedias, multipart newspaper editions, and works that are rare o=
r out of print, the regulations issued by the Register under section 408(c)=
 can be expected to make exceptions or special provisions.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">With respect to works published in the United States=
, a single deposit could be used to satisfy the deposit requirements of sec=
tion 407 and the registration requirements of section 408, if the applicati=
on and fee for registration are submitted at the same time and are accompan=
ied by "any additional identifying material" required by regulations. To se=
rve this dual purpose the deposit and registration would have to be made si=
multaneously; if a deposit under section 407 had already been made, an addi=
tional deposit would be required under section 408. In addition, since depo=
sit for the Library of Congress and registration of a claim to copyright se=
rve essentially different functions, section 408(b) authorizes the Register=
 of Copyrights to issue regulations under which deposit of additional mater=
ial, needed for identification of the work in which copyright is claimed, c=
ould be required in certain cases.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Administrative Classification.</strong> It i=
s important that the statutory provisions setting forth the subject matter =
of copyright be kept entirely separate from any classifica<!-- PDFPage:161 =
-->tion of copyrightable works for practical administrative purposes. Secti=
on 408(c)(1) thus leaves it to the Register of Copyrights to specify "the a=
dministrative classes into which works are to be placed for purposes of dep=
osit and registration," and makes clear that this administrative classifica=
tion "has no significance with respect to the subject matter of copyright o=
r the exclusive rights provided by this title."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Optional Deposit.</strong> Consistent with t=
he principle of administrative flexibility underlying all of the deposit an=
d registration provisions, subsection (c) of section 408 also gives the Reg=
ister latitude in adjusting the type of material deposited to the needs of =
the registration system. The Register is authorized to issue regulations sp=
ecifying "the nature of the copies of phonorecords to be deposited in the v=
arious classes" and, for particular classes, to require or permit deposit o=
f identifying material rather than copies or phonorecords, deposit of one c=
opy or phonorecord rather than two, or, in the case of a group of related w=
orks, a single rather than a number of separate registrations. Under this p=
rovision the Register could, where appropriate, permit deposit of phonoreco=
rds rather than notated copies of musical compositions, allow or require de=
posit of print-outs of computer programs under certain circumstances, or pe=
rmit deposit of one volume of an encyclopedia for purposes of registration =
of a single contribution.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Where the copies or phonorecords are bulky, unwieldy=
, easily broken, or otherwise impractical to file and retain as records ide=
ntifying the work registered, the Register would be able to require or perm=
it the substitute deposit of material that would better serve the purpose o=
f identification. Cases of this sort might include, for example, billboard =
posters, toys and dolls, ceramics and glassware, costume jewelry, and a wid=
e range of three-dimensional objects embodying copyrighted material. The Re=
gister's authority would also extend to rare or extremely valuable copies w=
hich would be burdensome or impossible to deposit. Deposit of one copy or p=
honorecord rather than two would probably be justifiable in the case of mos=
t motion pictures, and in any case where the Library of Congress has no nee=
d for the deposit and its only purpose is identification.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The provision empowering the Register to allow a num=
ber of related works to be registered together as a group represents a need=
ed and important liberalization of the law now in effect. At present the re=
quirement for separate registrations where related works or parts of a work=
 are published separately has created administrative problems and has resul=
ted in unnecessary burdens and expenses on authors and other copyright owne=
rs. In a number of cases the technical necessity for separate applications =
and fees has caused copyright owners to forego copyright altogether. Exampl=
es of cases where these undesirable and unnecessary results could be avoide=
d by allowing a single registration include the various editions or issues =
of a daily newspaper, a work published in serial installments, a group of r=
elated jewelry designs, a group of photographs by one photographer, a serie=
s of greeting cards related to each other in some way, or a group of poems =
by a single author.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Single Registration.</strong> Section 408(c)=
(2) directs the Register of Copyrights to establish regulations permitting =
under certain conditions a single registration for a group of works by the =
same individual author, all first published as contributions to periodicals=
, including newspapers, within a twelve-month period, on the basis of a sin=
gle deposit, application, and registration fee. It is required that each of=
 the works as first published have a separate copyright notice, and that th=
e name of the owner of copyright in the work, (or an abbreviation by which =
the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of=
 the owner) is the same in each notice. It is further required that the dep=
osit consist of one copy of the entire issue of the periodical, or of the e=
ntire section in the case of a newspaper, in which each contribution is fir=
st published. Finally, the application shall identify each work separately,=
 including the periodical containing it and its date of first publication.<=
/p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 408(c)(3) provides under certain conditions =
an alternative to the separate renewal registrations of subsection (a). If =
the specified conditions are met, a single renewal registration may be made=
 for a group of works by the same individual author, all first published as=
 contributions to periodicals, including newspapers, upon the filing of a s=
ingle application and fee. It is required that the renewal claimant or clai=
mants, and the basis of claim or claims under section 304(a), is the same f=
or each of the works; that the works were all copyrighted upon their first =
publication, either through separate copyright notice and registration or b=
y virtue of a general copyright notice in the periodical issue as a whole; =
that the renewal application and fee are received not more than twenty-eigh=
t or less than twenty-seven years after December 31 of the calendar year in=
 which all of the works were first published; and that the renewal applicat=
ion identifies each work separately, including the periodical containing it=
 and its date of first publication.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Corrections and Amplifications.</strong> Ano=
ther unsatisfactory aspect of the present law is the lack of any provision =
for correcting or amplifying the information given in a completed registrat=
ion. Subsection (d) of section 408 would remedy this by authorizing the Reg=
ister to establish "formal procedures for the filing of an application for =
supplementary registration," in order to correct an error or amplify the in=
formation in a copyright registration. The "error" to be corrected under su=
bsection (d) is an error by the applicant that the Copyright Office could n=
ot have been expected to note during its examination of the claim; where th=
e error in a registration is the result of the Copyright Office's own mista=
ke or oversight, the Office can make the correction on its own initiative a=
nd without recourse to the "supplementary registration" procedure.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under subsection (d), a supplementary registration i=
s subject to payment of a separate fee and would be maintained as an indepe=
ndent record, separate and apart from the record of the earlier registratio=
n it is intended to supplement. However, it would be required to identify c=
learly "the registration to be corrected or amplified" so that the two regi=
strations could be tied together by appropriate means in the Copyright Offi=
ce records. The original registration would not be expunged or cancelled; a=
s stated in the subsection: "The information contained in a supplementary r=
egistration augments but does not supersede that contained in the earlier r=
egistration."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Published Edition of Previously Registered W=
ork.</strong> The present statute requires that, where a work is registered=
 in unpublished form, it must be registered again when it is published, whe=
ther or not the published edition contains any new copyrightable material. =
Under the bill there would be no need to make a second registration for the=
 published edition unless it contains sufficient added material to be consi=
dered a "derivative work" or "compilation" under section 103.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">On the other hand, there will be a number of cases w=
here the copyright owner, although not required to do so, would like to hav=
e registration made for the published edition of the work, especially since=
 the owner will still be obliged to deposit copies or phonorecords of it in=
 the Copyright Office under section 407. From the point of view of the publ=
ic there are advantages in allowing the owner to do so, since registration =
for the published edition will put on record the facts about the work in th=

 a compilation or derivative work" the application include "an identificati=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">The first two subsections of section 410 set forth t=
he two basic duties of the Register of Copyrights with respect to copyright=
 registration: (1) to register the claim and issue a certificate if the Reg=
ister determines that "the material deposited constitutes copyrightable sub=
ject matter and that the other legal and formal requirements of this title =
have been met," and (2) to refuse registration and notify the applicant if =
the Register determines that "the material deposited does not constitute co=
pyrightable subject matter or that the claim is invalid for any other reaso=
n."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (c) deals with the probative effect of a =
certificate of registration issued by the Register under subsection (a). Un=
der its provisions, a certificate is required to be given prima facie weigh=
t in any judicial proceedings if the registration it covers was made "befor=
e or within five years after first publication of the work"; thereafter the=
 court is given discretion to decide what evidentiary weight the certificat=
e should be accorded. This five-year period is based on a recognition that =
the longer the lapse of time between publication and registration the less =
likely to be reliable are the facts stated in the certificate.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 410(c), a certificate is to "constitut=
e prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts st=
ated in the certificate." The principle that a certificate represents prima=
 facie evidence of copyright validity has been established in a long line o=
f court decisions, and it is a sound one. It is true that, unlike a patent =
claim, a claim to copyright is not examined for basic validity before a cer=
tificate is issued. On the other hand, endowing a copyright claimant who ha=
s obtained a certificate with a rebuttable presumption of the validity of t=
he copyright does not deprive the defendant in an infringement suit of any =
rights, it merely orders the burdens of proof. The plaintiff should not ord=
inarily be forced in the first instance to prove all of the multitude of fa=
cts that underline the validity of the copyright unless the defendant, by e=
ffectively challenging them, shifts the burden of doing so to the plaintiff=
.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 410(d), which is in accord with the present =
practice of the Copyright Office, makes the effective date of registration =
the day when an application, deposit, and fee "which are later determined b=
y the Register of Copyrights or by a court of competent jurisdiction to be =
acceptable for registration" have all been received. Where the three necess=
ary elements are received at different times the date of receipt of the las=
t of them is controlling, regardless of when the Copyright Office acts on t=
he claim. The provision not only takes account of the inevitable timelag be=
tween receipt of the application and other material and the issuance of the=
 certificate, but it also recognizes the possibility that a court might lat=
er find the Register wrong in refusing registration.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">The need for section 412 arises from two basic chang=
es the bill will make in the present law.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(1) Copyright registration for published works, =
which is useful and important to users and the public at large, would no lo=
nger be compulsory, and should therefore be induced in some practical way.<=
/p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">(2) The great body of unpublished works now prot=
ected at common law would automatically be brought under copyright and give=
n statutory protection. The remedies for infringement presently available a=
t common law should continue to apply to these works under the statute, but=
 they should not be given special statutory remedies unless the owner has, =
by registration, made a public record of his copyright claim.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under the general scheme of the bill, a copyright ow=
ner whose work has been infringed before registration would be entitled to =
the remedies ordinarily available in infringement cases: an injunction on t=
erms the court considers fair, and his actual damages plus any applicable p=
rofits not used as a measure of damages. However, section 412 would deny an=
y award of the special or "extraordinary" remedies of statutory damages or =
attorney's fees where infringement of copyright in an unpublished work bega=
n before registration or where, in the case of a published work, infringeme=
nt commenced after publication and before registration (unless registration=
 has been made within a grace period of three months after publication). Th=
ese provisions would be applicable to works of foreign and domestic origin =
alike.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In providing that statutory damages and attorney's f=
ees are not recoverable for infringement of unpublished, unregistered works=
, clause (1) of section 412 in no way narrows the remedies available under =
the present law. With respect to published works, clause (2) would generall=
y deny an award of those two special remedies where infringement takes plac=
e before registration. As an exception, however, the clause provides a grac=
e period of three months after publication during which registration can be=
 made without loss of remedies; full remedies could be recovered for any in=
fringement begun during the three months after publication if registration =
is made before that period has ended. This exception is needed to take care=
 of newsworthy or suddenly popular works which may be infringed almost as s=
oon as they are published, before the copyright owner has had a reasonable =
opportunity to register his claim.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">The bill, unlike the present law, contains a general=
 statement of what constitutes infringement of copyright. Section 501(a) id=
entifies a copyright infringer as someone who "violates any of the exclusiv=
e rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 118" of=
 the bill, or who imports copies or phonorecords in violation of section 60=
2. Under the latter section an unauthorized importation of copies or phonor=
ecords acquired abroad is an infringement of the exclusive right of distrib=
ution under certain circumstances.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The principle of the divisibility of copyright owner=
ship, established by section 201(d), carries with it the need in infringeme=
nt actions to safeguard the rights of all copyright owners and to avoid a m=
ultiplicity of suits. Subsection (b) of section 501 enables the owner of a =
particular right to bring an infringement action in that owner's name alone=
, while at the same time insuring to the extent possible that the other own=
ers whose rights may be affected are notified and given a chance to join th=
e action.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The first sentence of subsection (b) empowers the "l=
egal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right" to bring suit for "any infr=
ingement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">The two subsections of section 503 deal respectively=
 with the courts' power to impound allegedly infringing articles during the=
 time an action is pending, and to order the destruction or other dispositi=
on of articles found to be infringing. In both cases the articles affected =
include "all copies or phonorecords" which are claimed or found "to have be=
en made or used in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights," an=
d also "all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or oth=
er articles by means of which such copies of phonorecords may be reproduced=
." The alternative phrase "made or used" in both subsections enables a cour=
t to deal as it sees fit with articles which, though reproduced and acquire=
d lawfully, have been used for infringing purposes such as rentals, perform=
ances, and displays.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Articles may be impounded under subsection (a) "at a=
ny time while an action under this title is pending," thus permitting seizu=
res of articles alleged to be infringing as soon as suit has been filed and=
 without waiting for an injunction. The same subsection empowers the court =
to order impounding "on such terms as it may deem reasonable." The present =
Supreme Court rules with respect to seizure and impounding were issued even=
 though there is no specific provision authorizing them in the copyright st=
atute, and there appears no need for including a special provision on the p=
oint in the bill.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under section 101(d) of the present statute [section=
 101(d) of former title 17], articles found to be infringing may be ordered=
 to be delivered up for destruction. Section 503(b) of the bill would make =
this provision more flexible by giving the court discretion to order "destr=
uction or other reasonable disposition" of the articles found to be infring=
ing. Thus, as part of its final judgment or decree, the court could order t=
he infringing articles sold, delivered to the plaintiff, or disposed of in =
some other way that would avoid needless waste and best serve the ends of j=
ustice.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>In General.</strong> A cornerstone of the re=
medies sections and of the bill as a whole is section 504, the provision de=
aling with recovery of actual damages, profits, and statutory damages. The =
two basic aims of this section are reciprocal and correlative: (1) to give =
the courts specific unambiguous directions concerning monetary awards, thus=
 avoiding the confusion and uncertainty that have marked the present law on=
 the subject, and, at the same time, (2) to provide the courts with reasona=
ble latitude to adjust recovery to the circumstances of the case, thus avoi=
ding some of the artificial or overly technical awards resulting from the l=
anguage of the existing statute.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (a) lays the groundwork for the more deta=
iled provisions of the section by establishing the liability of a copyright=
 infringer for either "the copyright owner's actual damages and any additio=
nal profits of the infringer," or statutory damages. Recovery of actual dam=
ages and profits under section 504(b) or of statutory damages under section=
 504(c) is alternative and for the copyright owner to elect; as under the p=
resent law, the plaintiff in an infringement suit is not obliged to submit =
proof of damages and profits and may choose to rely on the provision for mi=
nimum statutory damages. However, there is nothing in section 504 to preven=
t a court from taking account of evidence concerning actual damages and pro=
fits in making an award of statutory damages within the range set out in su=
bsection (c).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Actual Damages and Profits.</strong> In allo=
wing the plaintiff to recover "the actual damages suffered by him or her as=
 a result of the infringement," plus any of the infringer's profits "that a=
re attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in compu=
ting the actual damages," section 504(b) recognizes the different purposes =
served by awards of damages and profits. Damages are awarded to compensate =
the copyright owner for losses from the infringement, and profits are award=
ed to prevent the infringer from unfairly benefiting from a wrongful act. W=
here the defendant's profits are nothing more than a measure of the damages=
 suffered by the copyright owner, it would be inappropriate to award damage=
s and profits cumulatively, since in effect they amount to the same thing. =
However, in cases where the copyright owner has suffered damages not reflec=
ted in the infringer's profits, or where there have been profits attributab=
le to the copyrighted work but not used as a measure of damages, subsection=
 (b) authorizes the award of both.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The language of the subsection makes clear that only=
 those profits "attributable to the infringement" are recoverable; where so=
me of the defendant's profits result from the infringement and other profit=
s are caused by <!-- PDFPage:170 -->different factors, it will be necessary=
 for the court to make an apportionment. However, the burden of proof is on=
 the defendant in these cases; in establishing profits the plaintiff need p=
rove only "the infringer's gross revenue," and the defendant must prove not=
 only "his or her deductible expenses" but also "the element of profit attr=
ibutable to factors other than the copyrighted work."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Statutory Damages.</strong> Subsection (c) o=
f section 504 makes clear that the plaintiff's election to recover statutor=
y damages may take place at any time during the trial before the court has =
rendered its final judgment. The remainder of clause (1) of the subsection =
represents a statement of the general rates applicable to awards of statuto=
ry damages. Its principal provisions may be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">1. As a general rule, where the plaintiff elects=
 to recover statutory damages, the court is obliged to award between $250 a=
nd $10,000. It can exercise discretion in awarding an amount within that ra=
nge but, unless one of the exceptions provided by clause (2) is applicable,=
 it cannot make an award of less than $250 or of more than $10,000 if the c=
opyright owner has chosen recovery under section 504(c).</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">2. Although, as explained below, an award of min=
imum statutory damages may be multiplied if separate works and separately l=
iable infringers are involved in the suit, a single award in the $250 to $1=
0,000 range is to be made "for all infringements involved in the action." A=
 single infringer of a single work is liable for a single amount between $2=
50 and $10,000, no matter how many acts of infringement are involved in the=
 action and regardless of whether the acts were separate, isolated, or occu=
rred in a related series.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">3. Where the suit involves infringement of more =
than one separate and independent work, minimum statutory damages for each =
work must be awarded. For example, if one defendant has infringed three cop=
yrighted works, the copyright owner is entitled to statutory damages of at =
least $750 and may be awarded up to $30,000. Subsection (c)(1) makes clear,=
 however, that, although they are regarded as independent works for other p=
urposes, "all the parts of a compilation or derivative work constitute one =
work" for this purpose. Moreover, although the minimum and maximum amounts =
are to be multiplied where multiple "works" are involved in the suit, the s=
ame is not true with respect to multiple copyrights, multiple owners, multi=
ple exclusive rights, or multiple registrations. This point is especially i=
mportant since, under a scheme of divisible copyright, it is possible to ha=
ve the rights of a number of owners of separate "copyrights" in a single "w=
ork" infringed by one act of a defendant.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body-1em">4. Where the infringements of one work were comm=
itted by a single infringer acting individually, a single award of statutor=
y damages would be made. Similarly, where the work was infringed by two or =
more joint tortfeasors, the bill would make them jointly and severally liab=
le for an amount in the $250 to $10,000 range. However, where separate infr=
ingements for which two or more defendants are not jointly liable are joine=
d in the same action, separate awards of statutory damages would be appropr=
iate.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Clause (2) of section 504(c) provides for exceptiona=
l cases in which the maximum award of statutory damages could be raised fro=
m $10,000 to $50,000, and in which the minimum recovery could be reduced fr=
om $250 to $100. The basic principle underlying this provision is that the =
courts should be given discretion to increase statutory damages in cases of=
 willful infringement and to lower the minimum where the infringer is innoc=
ent. The language of the clause makes clear that in these situations the bu=
rden of proving willfulness rests on the copyright owner and that of provin=
g innocence rests on the infringer, and that the court must make a finding =
of either willfulness or innocence in order to award the exceptional amount=
s.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The "innocent infringer" provision of section 504(c)=
(2) has been the subject of extensive discussion. The exception, which woul=
d allow reduction of minimum statutory damages to $100 where the infringer =
"was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constitute=
d an infringement of copyright," is sufficient to protect against unwarrant=
ed liability in cases of occasional or isolated innocent infringement, and =
it offers adequate insulation to users, such as broadcasters and newspaper =
publishers, who are particularly vulnerable to this type of infringement su=
it. On the other hand, by establishing a realistic floor for liability, the=
 provision preserves its intended deterrent effect; and it would not allow =
an infringer to escape simply because the plaintiff failed to disprove the =
defendant's claim of innocence.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">In addition to the general "innocent infringer" prov=
ision clause (2) deals with the special situation of teachers, librarians, =
archivists, and public broadcasters, and the nonprofit institutions of whic=
h they are a part. Section 504(c)(2) provides that, where such a person or =
institution infringed copyrighted material in the honest belief that what t=
hey were doing constituted fair use, the court is precluded from awarding a=
ny statutory damages. It is intended that, in cases involving this provisio=
n, the burden of proof with respect to the defendant's good faith should re=
st on the plaintiff.</p>

<p class=3D"statutory-body">In the case of any performing rights society su=
bject to a consent decree which provides for the determination of reasonabl=
e license rates or fees to be charged by the performing rights society, not=
withstanding the provisions of that consent decree, an individual proprieto=
r who owns or operates fewer than 7 non-publicly traded establishments in w=
hich nondramatic musical works are performed publicly and who claims that a=
ny license agreement offered by that performing rights society is unreasona=
ble in its license rate or fee as to that individual proprietor, shall be e=
ntitled to determination of a reasonable license rate or fee as follows:</p=
>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(1) The individual proprietor may commence =
such proceeding for determination of a reasonable license rate or fee by fi=
ling an application in the applicable district court under paragraph (2) th=
at a rate disagreement exists and by serving a copy of the application on t=
he performing rights society. Such proceeding shall commence in the applica=
ble district court within 90 days after the service of such copy, except th=
at such 90-day requirement shall be subject to the administrative requireme=
nts of the court.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(2) The proceeding under paragraph (1) shal=
l be held, at the individual proprietor's election, in the judicial distric=
t of the district court with jurisdiction over the applicable consent decre=
e or in that place of holding court of a district court that is the seat of=
 the Federal circuit (other than the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circu=
it) in which the proprietor's establishment is located.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(3) Such proceeding shall be held before th=
e judge of the court with jurisdiction over the consent decree governing th=
e performing rights society. At the discretion of the court, the proceeding=
 shall be held before a special master or magistrate judge appointed by suc=
h judge. Should that consent decree provide for the appointment of an advis=
or or advisors to the court for any purpose, any such advisor shall be the =
special master so named by the court.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(4) In any such proceeding, the industry ra=
te shall be presumed to have been reasonable at the time it was agreed to o=
r determined by the court. Such presumption shall in no way affect a determ=
ination of whether the rate is being correctly applied to the individual pr=
oprietor.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(5) Pending the completion of such proceedi=
ng, the individual proprietor shall have the right to perform publicly the =
copyrighted musical compositions in the repertoire of the performing rights=
 society by paying an interim license rate or fee into an interest bearing =
escrow account with the clerk of the court, subject to retroactive adjustme=
nt when a final rate or fee has been determined, in an amount equal to the =
industry rate, or, in the absence of an industry rate, the amount of the mo=
st recent license rate or fee agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(6) Any decision rendered in such proceedin=
g by a special master or magistrate judge named under paragraph (3) shall b=
e reviewed by the judge of the court with jurisdiction over the consent dec=
ree governing the performing rights society. Such proceeding, including suc=
h review, shall be concluded within 6 months after its commencement.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(7) Any such final determination shall be b=
inding only as to the individual proprietor commencing the proceeding, and =
shall not be applicable to any other proprietor or any other performing rig=
hts society, and the performing rights society shall be relieved of any obl=
igation of nondiscrimination among similarly situated music users that may =
be imposed by the consent decree governing its operations.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:179 --><p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(8) An individual propr=

or the determination of a reasonable license rate or fee under any license =
agreement with respect to any one performing rights society.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(9) For purposes of this section, the term =
"industry rate" means the license fee a performing rights society has agree=

<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Scope of the Section.</strong> Section 602, =
which has nothing to do with the manufacturing requirements of section 601,=
 deals with two separate situations: importation of "piratical" articles (t=
hat is, copies or phonorecords <!-- PDFPage:180 -->made without any authori=
zation of the copyright owner), and unauthorized importation of copies or p=
honorecords that were lawfully made. The general approach of section 602 is=
 to make unauthorized importation an act of infringement in both cases, but=
 to permit the United States Customs Service to prohibit importation only o=
f "piratical" articles.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Section 602(a) first states the general rule that un=
authorized importation is an infringement merely if the copies or phonoreco=
rds "have been acquired outside the United States", but then enumerates thr=
ee specific exceptions: (1) importation under the authority or for the use =
of a governmental body, but not including material for use in schools or co=
pies of an audiovisual work imported for any purpose other than archival us=
e; (2) importation for the private use of the importer of no more than one =
copy or phonorecord of a work at a time, or of articles in the personal bag=
gage of travelers from abroad; or (3) importation by nonprofit organization=
s "operated for scholarly, educational, or religious purposes" of "no more =
than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for archival purposes, and no m=
ore than five copies or phonorecords of any other work for its library lend=
ing or archival purposes." The bill specifies that the third exception does=
 not apply if the importation "is part of an activity consisting of systema=
tic reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such organization in violat=
ion of the provisions of section 108(g)(2)."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">If none of the three exemptions applies, any unautho=
rized importer of copies or phonorecords acquired abroad could be sued for =
damages and enjoined from making any use of them, even before any public di=
stribution in this country has taken place.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Importation of "Piratical" Copies.</strong> =
Section 602(b) retains the present statute's prohibition against importatio=
n of "piratical" copies or phonorecords=E2=80=94those whose making "would h=
ave constituted an infringement of copyright if this title has been applica=
ble." Thus, the Customs Service could exclude copies or phonorecords that w=
ere unlawful in the country where they were made; it could also exclude cop=
ies or phonorecords which, although made lawfully under the domestic law of=
 that country, would have been unlawful if the U.S. copyright law could hav=
e been applied. A typical example would be a work by an American author whi=
ch is in the public domain in a foreign country because that country does n=
ot have copyright relations with the United States; the making and publicat=
ion of an authorized edition would be lawful in that country, but the Custo=
ms Service could prevent the importation of any copies of that edition.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Importation for Infringing Distribution.</st=
rong> The second situation covered by section 602 is that where the copies =
or phonorecords were lawfully made but their distribution in the United Sta=
tes would infringe the U.S. copyright owner's exclusive rights. As already =
said, the mere act of importation in this situation would constitute an act=
 of infringement and could be enjoined. However, in cases of this sort it w=
ould be impracticable for the United States Customs Service to attempt to e=
nforce the importation prohibition, and section 602(b) provides that, unles=
s a violation of the manufacturing requirements is also involved, the Servi=
ce has no authority to prevent importation, "where the copies or phonorecor=
ds were lawfully made." The subsection would authorize the establishment of=
 a procedure under which copyright owners could arrange for the Customs Ser=
vice to notify them wherever articles appearing to infringe their works are=
 imported.</p>

<h4 class=3D"note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class=3D"note-head">house report no. 94=E2=80=931476</h4>
<p class=3D"note-body">Chapter 7 entitled "Copyright Office," sets forth th=
e administrative and housekeeping provisions of the bill.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Administrative Procedure Act.</strong> Under=
 an amendment to section 701 adopted by the Committee, the Copyright Office=
 is made fully subject to the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 551 et=
 seq. and 701 et seq.] with one exception: under section 706(b), reproducti=
on and distribution of copyright deposit copies would be made under the Fre=
edom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552] only to the extent permitted by the =
Copyright Office regulations.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Retention and Disposition of Deposited Artic=
les.</strong> A recurring problem in the administration of the copyright la=
w has been the need to reconcile the storage limitations of the Copyright O=
ffice with the continued value of deposits in identifying copyrighted works=
. Aside from its indisputable utility to future historians and scholars, a =
substantially complete collection of both published and unpublished deposit=
s, other than those selected by the Library of Congress, would avoid the ma=
ny difficulties encountered when copies needed for identification in connec=
tion with litigation or other purposes have been destroyed. The basic polic=
y behind section 704 is that copyright deposits should be retained as long =
as possible, but that the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congr=
ess should be empowered to dispose of them under appropriate safeguards whe=
n they decide that it has become necessary to do so.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Under subsection (a) of section 704, any copy, phono=
record, or identifying material deposited for registration, whether registe=
red or not, becomes "the property of the United States Government." This me=
ans that the copyright owner or person who made the deposit cannot demand i=
ts return as a matter of right, even in rejection cases, although the provi=
sions of section 407 and 408 are flexible enough to allow for special arran=
gements in exceptional cases. On the other hand, Government ownership of de=
posited articles under section 704(a) carries with it no privileges under t=
he copyright itself; use of a deposited article in violation of the copyrig=
ht owner's exclusive rights would be infringement.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">With respect to published works, section 704(b) make=
s all deposits available to the Library of Congress "for its collections, o=
r for exchanges or transfer to any other library"; where the work is unpubl=
ished, the Library is authorized to select any deposit for its own collecti=
ons or for transfer to the National Archives of the United States or to a F=
ederal records center.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Motion picture producers have expressed some concern=
 lest the right to transfer copies of works, such as motion pictures, that =
have been published under rental, lease, or loan arrangements, might lead t=
o abuse. However, the Library of Congress has not knowingly transferred wor=
ks of this sort to other libraries in the past, and there is no reason to e=
xpect it to do so in the future.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">The Committee added a new subsection (c) to section =
704, under which the Register is authorized to make microfilm or other reco=
rd copies of copyright deposits before transferring or otherwise disposing =
of them.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">For deposits not selected by the Library, subsection=
 (d) provides that they, or "identifying portions or reproductions of them,=
" are to be retained under Copyright Office control "for the longest period=
 considered practicable and desirable" by the Register and the Librarian. W=
hen and if they ultimately decide that retention of certain deposited artic=
les is no longer "practicable and desirable," the Register and Librarian ha=
ve joint discretion to order their "destruction or other disposition." Beca=
use of the unique value and irreplaceable nature of unpublished deposits, t=
he subsection prohibits their intentional destruction during their copyrigh=
t term, unless a facsimile reproduction has been made.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body">Subsection (e) of section 704 establishes a new proc=
edure under which a copyright owner can request retention of deposited mate=
rial for the full term of copyright. The Register of Copyrights is authoriz=
ed to issue regulations prescribing the fees for this service and the "cond=
itions under which such requests are to be made and granted."</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Catalog of Copyright Entries.</strong> Secti=
on 707(a) of the bill retains the present statute's basis requirement that =
the Register compile and publish catalogs of all copyright registrations at=
 periodic intervals, but provides for "discretion to determine, on the basi=
s of practicability and usefulness the form and frequency of publication of=
 each particular part". This provision will in no way diminish the utility =
or value of the present catalogs, and the flexibility of approach, coupled =
with use of the new mechanical and electronic devices now becoming availabl=
e, will avoid waste and result in a better product.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Copyright Office Fees.</strong> The schedule=
 of fees set out in section 708 reflects a general increase in the fees of =
the Copyright Office from those established by the Congress in 1965. The ba=
sic fees are $10 for registration, $6 for renewal registration, $10 for rec=
ordation of documents and $10 per hour for searching. The section also cont=
ains new fee provisions needed because of new requirements or services esta=
blished under the bill, and subsection (a)(11) authorizes the Register to f=
ix additional fees, on the "basis of the cost of providing the service," "f=
or any other special services requiring a substantial amount of time or exp=
ense." Subsection (b) makes clear that, except for the possibility of waive=
rs in "occasional or isolated cases involving relatively small amounts," th=
e Register is to charge fees for services rendered to other Government agen=
cies.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Postal Interruptions.</strong> Section 709 a=
uthorizes the Register of Copyrights to issue regulation to permit the acce=
ptance by the Copyright Office of documents which are delivered after the c=
lose of the prescribed period if the delay was caused by a general disrupti=
on or suspension of postal or other transportation or communications servic=
es.</p>
<p class=3D"note-body"><strong>Reproductions for the Blind and Handicapped.=
</strong> Section 710 directs the Register of Copyrights to establish by re=
gulation forms and procedures by which the copyright owners of certain cate=
gories of works may voluntarily grant to the Library of Congress a license =
to reproduce and distribute copies or phonorecords of the work solely for t=
he use of the blind and physically handicapped.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(a) The owner of a mask work may apply to the R=
egister of Copyrights for registration of a claim of protection in a mask w=
ork. Protection of a mask work under this chapter shall terminate if applic=
ation for registration of a claim of protection in the mask work is not mad=
e as provided in this chapter within two years after the date on which the =
mask work is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(b) The Register of Copyrights shall be respons=
ible for all administrative functions and duties under this chapter. Except=
 for section 708, the provisions of chapter 7 of this title relating to the=
 general responsibilities, organization, regulatory authority, actions, rec=
ords, and publications of the Copyright Office shall apply to this chapter,=
 except that the Register of Copyrights may make such changes as may be nec=
essary in applying those provisions to this chapter.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(c) The application for registration of a mask =
work shall be made on a form prescribed by the Register of Copyrights. Such=
 form may require any information regarded by the Register as bearing upon =
the preparation or identification of the mask work, the existence or durati=
on of protection of the mask work under this chapter, or ownership of the m=
ask work. The application shall be accompanied by the fee set pursuant to s=
ubsection (d) and the identifying material specified pursuant to such subse=
ction.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(d) The Register of Copyrights shall by regulat=
ion set reasonable fees for the filing of applications to register claims o=
f protection in mask works under this chapter, and for other services relat=
ing to the administration of this chapter or the rights under this chapter,=
 taking into consideration the cost of providing those services, the benefi=
ts of a public record, and statutory fee schedules under this title. The Re=
gister shall also specify the identifying material to be deposited in conne=
ction with the claim for registration.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(e) If the Register of Copyrights, after examin=
ing an application for registration, determines, in accordance with the pro=
visions of this chapter, that the application relates to a mask work which =
is entitled to protection under this chapter, then the Register shall regis=
ter the claim of protection and issue to the applicant a certificate of reg=
istration of the claim of protection under the seal of the Copyright Office=
. The effective date of registration of a claim of protection shall be the =
date on which an application, deposit of identifying material, and fee, whi=
ch are determined by the Register of Copyrights or by a court of competent =
jurisdiction to be acceptable for registration of the claim, have all been =
received in the Copyright Office.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(f) In any action for infringement under this c=
hapter, the certificate of registration of a mask work shall constitute pri=
ma facie evidence (1) of the facts stated in the certificate, and (2) that =
the applicant issued the certificate has met the requirements of this chapt=
er, and the regulations issued under this chapter, with respect to the regi=
stration of claims.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(g) Any applicant for registration under this s=
ection who is dissatisfied with the refusal of the Register of Copyrights t=
o issue a certificate of registration under this section may seek judicial =
review of that refusal by bringing an action for such review in an appropri=
ate United States district court not later than sixty days after the refusa=
l. The provisions of chapter 7 of title 5 shall apply to such judicial revi=
ew. The failure of the Register of Copyrights to issue a certifi<!-- PDFPag=
e:204 -->cate of registration within four months after an application for r=
egistration is filed shall be deemed to be a refusal to issue a certificate=
 of registration for purposes of this subsection and section 910(b)(2), exc=
ept that, upon a showing of good cause, the district court may shorten such=
 four-month period.</p>

"any person" includes any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any of=
ficer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or=
 her official capacity. Any State, and any such instrumentality, officer, o=
r employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same =
manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(b)(1) The owner of a mask work protected under=
 this chapter, or the exclusive licensee of all rights under this chapter w=
ith respect to the mask work, shall, after a certificate of registration of=
 a claim of protection in that mask work has been issued under section 908,=
 be entitled to institute a civil action for any infringement with respect =
to the mask work which is committed after the commencement of protection of=
 the mask work under section 904(a).</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(2) In any case in which an application for reg=
istration of a claim of protection in a mask work and the required deposit =
of identifying material and fee have been received in the Copyright Office =
in proper form and registration of the mask work has been refused, the appl=
icant is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement under this c=
hapter with respect to the mask work if notice of the action, together with=
 a copy of the complaint, is served on the Register of Copyrights, in accor=
dance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Register may, at his o=
r her option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of whe=
ther the claim of protection is eligible for registration by entering an ap=
pearance within sixty days after such service, but the failure of the Regis=
ter to become a party to the action shall not deprive the court of jurisdic=

<p class=3D"statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Un=

of articles from the United States, that the person seeking exclusion take =
any one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(A) Obtain a court order enjoining, or an o=
rder of the International Trade Commission under section 337 of the Tariff =
Act of 1930 excluding, importation of the articles.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body-1em">(B) Furnish proof that the mask work involv=

 would infringe the rights in the mask work under this chapter.</p>

may result if the detention or exclusion of the articles proves to be unjus=

<p class=3D"statutory-body">(2) Articles imported in violation of the right=
s set forth in section 905 are subject to seizure and forfeiture in the sam=
e manner as property imported in violation of the customs laws. Any such fo=
rfeited articles shall be destroyed as directed by the Secretary of the Tre=
asury or the court, as the case may be, except that the articles may be ret=

the Secretary of the Treasury that the importer had no reasonable grounds f=

<p class=3D"statutory-body">(b) Upon finding an infringer liable, to a pers=
on entitled under section 910(b)(1) to institute a civil action, for an inf=

such person actual damages suffered by the person as a result of the infrin=

 are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in com=
puting the award of actual damages. In establishing the infringer's profits=
, such person is required to present proof only of the infringer's gross re=
venue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expense=

<p class=3D"statutory-body">(c) At any time before final judgment is render=

th respect to any one mask work for which any one infringer is liable indiv=

her products by means of which such products may be reproduced, that are cl=
aimed to have been made, imported, or used in violation of those exclusive =
